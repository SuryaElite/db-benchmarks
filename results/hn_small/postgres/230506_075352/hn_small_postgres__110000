It keeps people tied to your Service as a Software Substitute, and as long long as most people are still ignorant about how technology works, they won&#x27;t notice how the stalker-like nature of a lot of modern soft^H^H^H^Hmalware.<p>As for the few nerds that notice, they can probably be shut up with an obscure option to disable (most of?) the data collection; the number of people that even know the option exists will be insignificant. Some of those nerds can even be distracted with promises of &quot;open&quot; access (to our proprietary APIs we can remove or change without notice); if you phrase it right, it can even sound like &quot;open&quot; is referring to the commons. After a while, some of them may even build entire businesses based on feeding user surveillance data upstream. After a generation, the days of being able to write client software will be long forgotten.<p>--<p>The ongoing Theft Of Privacy (and the closely related The War On General Purpose Computing) are being fought, and this brazen behavior by Microsoft to take advantage user ignorance is taking yet another step down a dark path.<p>Which side are you going to be on? The side that is trying to maintain the remains of our privacy, an open internet, and free computing?<p>The apathetic side that fixes technical problems for themselves, while everybody else gets spied upon a little bit more while their tools become even more removed from their control? I hope you enjoy the consequences of rewarding this kind of behavior. Why should Microsoft (or anybody else) change when they still get paid and maintain their user-count?<p>Or are you the apparatchik, who thinks Cortana (or Alexa, or Siri, ... or Google Analytics) is a useful, cool piece of software? Surely the Big Data being collected is just going to be used for the stated purposes and could never have a noxious effect on users or become an attractive target for hackers or governments?

You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc". If you think of "Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process. If you can't find talent, my guess is that you are probably failing in one or more areas above.<p>EDIT: Formatting";}i:1;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"47";s:14:"comment_author";s:9:"mikeocool";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3353020";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"27";s:12:"comment_text";s:952:"Did you customize your email at all for each company?<p>As someone on the receiving end, I'm way more likely to send you a personal response if you've sent me a personal email, regardless of whether you seem like a good fit for the job.

Consider a few results from encryption and what it presents to the adversary:<p><pre><code>    pw(ABC)     == 928
    pw(ABCABC)  == 928362
</code></pre>
If ABC is a seed to the algorithm, then any seed that shares a prefix and a final character will have information leaked, sometimes enough to reveal the entire generated password for a different seed.<p>Its actually worse than this.  For example, if the adversary knows that:<p><pre><code>    pw(AAT)  == 941
    pw(ABC)  == 928
    pw(BBC)  == 717
</code></pre>
then the adversary knows that the mapping from the character C to an integer is the same as the mapping from character T.  Using the terminology presented in the lecture this is<p><pre><code>    f(C) == f(T)
</code></pre>
and from this adversary can determine information about the result of the password algorithm on other seeds.<p><pre><code>    pw(BBT)  == 717
    pw(B.*T) == 7.*
</code></pre>
Because the algorithm uses a recurrence that generates one ciphertext character from the result of preceding  ciphertext character, the adversary can make further inferences:<p><pre><code>    pw(BAT)  == 728
</code></pre>
which implies that if the preceding ciphertext is 7 and the current seed character is A that the resulting ciphertext will be 2.  Consider<p><pre><code>    pw(BAT)   == 728
    pw(XAB)   == 725
    pw(XAAB)  == 7271
    pw(XAAAB) == 72725
</code></pre>
End ---%&lt;------------%&lt;---------------------------------<p>My second email on Sept 30, 2014 contained the solution to a challenge he proposed in the video of a lecture on the method he gave:<p>Begin ---%&lt;------------%&lt;---------------------------------<p>On one slide during your recent lecture, you present a bit of a challenge, and I noticed that by making use of just the four plaintext&#x2F;ciphertext pairs:<p><pre><code>    BRAIN -&gt; 06076
    TRAIN -&gt; 27732
    GRAIN -&gt; 35618
    DRAIN -&gt; 54349
</code></pre>
One can conclude that the permutation of [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] that controls the mapping g() must be one of the cycles:<p><pre><code>    6159073428  
    8106279354  &lt;- this turns out to be the one
</code></pre>
In fact, with a bit more work one can deduce that it is the second by making use of the additional plaintext&#x2F;ciphertext pair (which appears on the same slide):<p><pre><code>    AND -&gt; 496
</code></pre>
So now we know that<p><pre><code>    g(0) -&gt; 6
    g(1) -&gt; 0
    g(2) -&gt; 7
    g(3) -&gt; 5
    g(4) -&gt; 8
    g(5) -&gt; 0
    g(6) -&gt; 2
    g(7) -&gt; 9
    g(8) -&gt; 1
    g(9) -&gt; 3
</code></pre>
With g() in hand, it is short work to build up the mapping of f().  For these five words, the letters involved are A, B, D, G, I, N, R, and T.<p><pre><code>    f(A) -&gt; 5
    f(B) -&gt; 8
    f(D) -&gt; 0
    f(G) -&gt; 6
    f(I) -&gt; 2
    f(N) -&gt; 3
    f(R) -&gt; 0
    f(T) -&gt; 0
</code></pre>
Notes on decryption
===================<p>The details of this decryption aren&#x27;t very interesting, so I wont go into detail.  I didn&#x27;t need to use a computer, just paper and pencil.  The important observation was that from BRAIN -&gt; 06076 one knows<p>g(0 + f(R)) -&gt; 6<p>and from TRAIN -&gt; 27732 one knows<p>g(2 + f(R)) -&gt; 7<p>thus if g(k) -&gt; 6, g(k+2) -&gt; 7.<p>This means that map(g, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) is some rotation of the list [_,_,_,_6,_,7,_,_,_,_] where 6 and 7 are at two locations apart.<p>Every letter, say &#x27;A&#x27;, which appears in more than two places in any of the plaintext&#x2F;ciphertext pairs reveals information about g().  So BRAIN -&gt; 06076
and TRAIN -&gt; 27732 also reveals that<p>g(6 + f(A)) -&gt; 0  and  g(7 + f(A)) -&gt; 7<p>Therefore, if g(k) -&gt; 0 then g(k+1) -&gt; 7.  Thus, we can now conclude that map(g, [0,...,9]) is some rotation of [_,_,_,_,6,0,7,_,_,_].<p>In this fashion I concluded that map(g,[0,...,9]) was some rotation of
[2,9,1,3,6,0,7,5,8,4].  I knew that g()&#x27;s corresponding permutation was a circular permutation with a single cycle because that was a part of the system that makes it easier to memorize.<p>In general, of course, there could be ten possible mappings, one for each rotation.  However, in practice some of these rotations
won&#x27;t produce a permutation with a single cycle.  This isn&#x27;t really a problem because ten possible mappings for g() are still easy to validate in the next phase where we derive the mapping f().  In this particular case, there were only two possible circular permutations making it easy to decrypt the system with just paper and pencil.<p>The next step is to try out each of the possible g()&#x27;s determined above on the plaintext&#x2F;ciphertext pairs.  For example, BRAIN -&gt; 06076 implies that<p>g(0 + f(R)) = 6<p>applying the inverse map of g() to both sides<p>0 + f(R) = 0<p>so<p>f(R) -&gt; 0<p>In this manner the entire decryption can be performed.<p>End ---%&lt;------------%&lt;---------------------------------";s:12:"story_author";s:8:"jalcazar";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"24";s:8:"story_id";s:8:"10196485";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:14;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"75";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"gatlin";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3352077";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"10";s:12:"comment_text";s:661:"I applied to a kind-of sinking ship in Palo Alto last year.

I've been following the company for a while and recently drove the Model S.  Amazing car in almost every way.  What struck me was that it's not an incremental improvement but really a radical (might I say disruptive) improvement in terms of ride quality (super quiet), handling (low center of gravity with skateboard powertrain), electronics (17" touchscreen), cargo space (heard of the frunk?), reliability (electric cars have far less moving parts), and store experience (Tesla retail stores are a way better customer experience than a typical car dealership).  It's difficult to drive a Model S and NOT say that you've driven the future.<p>The Model S is so good that all they need to do is make it into a SUV (Model X) and they'll have the coolest high-end SUV (coming 2014).<p>Then, they just need to make the Model S smaller (GenIII Bluestar) and then they'll have the best small luxury sport sedan on the market (ie., BMW 3 series, Lexus IS, Audi A4 market).  Elon Musk has said they're going after the BMW 3 Series market with the GenIII car, and he's determined to make a best car in that market.  Just like the Model S is better than a BMW 5 Series in most regards, the GenIII will be better than the BMW 3 Series in most regards.  I know it might be difficult for many people to accept that (especially since the BMW 3 Series is legendary) but Tesla's got all the right pieces and has proven they can do it with the Model S.  Again, they just need to shrink the Model S and make it more affordable.<p>But GenIII is slated for 2015 at the earliest and it takes a while to dominate a car segment even after you have a stellar car.  I expect Tesla to become increasingly competitive (in terms of # sales) to the BMW 3 series by 2020 and perhaps dominant by 2025 (if not earlier).<p>Elon Musk has repeatedly said that Tesla Motors is not a typical car company but rather a technology company that will innovate at a blistering pace.

Forcing people into Procrustean categories more narrow than &quot;citizen&quot; for the people of one country builds division in the country and keeps people from treating their neighbors humanely as their fellow human beings. That kind of categorization was wrong and a moral outrage in the days of Jim Crow legally enforced segregation and it is still a bad idea today, even to correct the previous wrong.<p>I care about this issue deeply. I&#x27;m a baby boomer, which is another way of saying that I&#x27;m a good bit older than most people who post on Hacker News. I distinctly remember the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated--the most memorable day of early childhood for many people in my generation--and I remember the &quot;long hot summer&quot; and other events of the 1960s civil rights movement.<p>One early memory I have is of a second grade classmate (I still remember his name, which alas is just common enough that it is hard to Google him up) who moved back to Minnesota with his northern &quot;white&quot; parents after spending his early years in Alabama. He told me frightening stories about Ku Klux Klan violence to black people (the polite term in those days was &quot;Negroes&quot;), including killing babies, and I was very upset to hear about that kind of terrorism happening in the United States. He made me aware of a society in which people didn&#x27;t all treat one another with decency and human compassion, unlike the only kind of society I was initially aware of from growing up where I did. So I followed subsequent news about the civil rights movement, including the activities of Martin Luther King, Jr. up to his assassination, with great interest.<p>It happens that I had a fifth-grade teacher, a typically pale, tall, and blonde Norwegian-American, who was a civil rights activist and who spent her summers in the south as a freedom rider. She used to tell our class about how she had to modify her car (by removing the dome light and adding a locking gas cap) so that Klan snipers couldn&#x27;t shoot her as she opened her car door at night or put foreign substances into her gas tank. She has been a civil rights activist all her life, and when I Googled her a few years ago and regained acquaintance with her, I was not at all surprised to find that she is a member of the civil rights commission of the town where I grew up.<p>One day in fifth grade we had a guest speaker in our class, a young man who was then studying at St. Olaf College through the A Better Chance (ABC) affirmative action program. (To me, the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; still means active recruitment of underrepresented minority students, as it did in those days, and I have always thought that such programs are a very good idea, as some people have family connections to selective colleges, but many other people don&#x27;t.) During that school year (1968-1969), there was a current controversy in the United States about whether the term &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;Afro-American&quot; or &quot;black&quot; was most polite. So a girl in my class asked our visitor, &quot;What do you want to be called, &#x27;black&#x27; or &#x27;Afro-American&#x27;?&quot; His answer was, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be called Henry.&quot; Henry&#x27;s answer to my classmate&#x27;s innocent question really got me thinking. Why not treat all of my neighbors as individuals, one at a time?<p>And anyway I&#x27;ve seen this issue go wrong for people in other countries. Also in my childhood, in the other state I lived in growing up, I had a classmate in the early 1970s who would get on the school bus each day wearing a button that said &quot;Serb Power.&quot; I thought that was very strange, because I knew my history well enough to know that Serbia hadn&#x27;t been an independent country since Yugoslavia was formed after World War I. And, anyway, he was living in the United States and had been born here, so why was he so concerned about Serb power? We all found out during the early 1990s how crazy many people in Yugoslavia were about former historical grievances, which made that country disintegrate and killed many innocent people born long after the grievances should have been forgotten.<p>Most reporting to the federal government about &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; is based on the U.S. Census bureau definitions for ethnicity and race categories, which in turn are based on regulations from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which were announced on 30 October 1997<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitehouse.gov&#x2F;omb&#x2F;fedreg_1997standards</a><p>to take effect no later than 1 January 2003 for data collection by all federal agencies. You can look up the detailed category definitions on the website of the United States Bureau of the Census. As the Census Bureau itself notes,<p>&quot;U.S. federal government agencies must adhere to standards issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in October 1997, which specify that  race  and Hispanic origin (also known as ethnicity) are two separate and distinct concepts.  These standards generally reflect a social definition of race and ethnicity recognized in this country and they do not conform to any biological, anthropological, or genetic criteria.  The standards include five minimum categories for data on race:  &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native,&quot; &quot;Asian,&quot; &quot;Black or African American,&quot; &quot;Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,&quot; and &quot;White.&quot;  There are two minimum categories for data on ethnicity:  &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; and &quot;Not Hispanic or Latino.&quot;  The concept of race reflects self-identification by people according to the race or races with which they most closely identify.  Persons who report themselves as Hispanic can be of any race and are identified as such in our data tables.&quot;<p><a href="https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.census.gov&#x2F;faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191</a><p>It&#x27;s politics all the way down.

Unless both the two companies that stopped at the phone screen simultaneously filled the position immediately after your phone screen, you really need to recognize that at least those two phone screens did not go well.  I do interviews at a large Internet company, and one of my goals--one of the goals that I've been trained to seek--is to ensure that the candidate, no matter how bad, walks away from the interview feeling good about himself/herself and the company.  If you're doing really poorly in an interview, I'll toss you some easier questions than I normally give, because I have all the information I need, and I don't want you to have a negative experience with my company.  You may have felt good about the phone screens, but the most likely explanation for the two companies that didn't bring you onsite is that you didn't actually do well enough to justify additional interviews.  These people <i>want</i> to hire someone, and if you were someone they wanted to hire, they certainly <i>would</i> have continued to interview you.<p>I think your experiment was less valid than you think it was because you're less competent than you think you are.<p>EDIT: I should add that whatever the case, whether I'm right or wrong about you, the best response to the situation you're in is to seek to improve yourself, not to embark on a quixotic venture to change others.

I sent emails to ~50 different companies (some well-known, others unknown) that were looking for "Sr. Developers", particularly Ruby devs, as found on the major developer job sites (stackoverflow, Dice, Indeed, 37signals etc). I mainly targeted companies that were potentially/maybe/sorta/kinda/probably/possibly able to accomodate some form of telecommuting/remoting. I also picked companies that most closely matched my skillset. In my email I introduced myself and included my resume. Here is how I am represented in the email (paraphrased from actual text, ):<p>Given: X &#62; 7 &#38; Y &#62; 4,<p>"Sr. Level Developer, with X years exp. Y years of prof exp with Ruby.

You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc". If you think of "Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process. If you can't find talent, my guess is that you are probably failing in one or more areas above.<p>EDIT: Formatting";}i:2;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"93";s:14:"comment_author";s:11:"briancooley";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1383515";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:463:"<i>I like how I feel when I am using the thing</i><p>This sums up my opinion on the iPad.

A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on.

You prove your theorems more or less by typing out the proofs and the system mechanically verifies that each step in your proof is sound. I&#x27;ve used Coq and I&#x27;ll be honest. This is unquestionably a solid way to prove things about your program but it is too much of pain to expect this to have significant adoption in the &quot;real&quot; world.<p>In the hardware world, there&#x27;s been a lot of progress in automated verification thanks to modern model checkers [1,2] (which incidentally build on modern SAT, and in some cases SMT, solvers [3-6]). The nice thing about model checkers is that you just specify the property you want proven and let the verifier crunch away and it will (hopefully) come up with a proof or a counterexample. This has been successful enough that there are companies like JASPER and OneSpin which make money by selling hardware companies formal verification tools.<p>I worked with JASPER&#x27;s tools in the recent-ish past and one of the big things they seem to have done is make the tool much more usable. With the JASPER tool, it was much less of a pain to configure the model checker, abstract away parts of the design, keep track of the properties specified and proven, examine counter example traces and so forth than I was expecting. A lot of this sort of thing doesn&#x27;t get done in academic tools like ABC because it doesn&#x27;t count as research. But such improvements are extremely important if you want to push adoption of formal tools in an industrial setting. And from what I can see the emphasis on usability seems to paying off for JASPER.<p>Model checking in software has been less successful because the state explosion problem is much more pronounced but there have been notable success stories like Microsoft Research&#x27;s SLAM project [7]. And I definitely think there is an opportunity here to build upon the algorithmic progress in automated verification in order to build tools that are much usable in a software setting.<p>[1] <a href="http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bradleya/ic3/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecee.colorado.edu&#x2F;~bradleya&#x2F;ic3&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/abc.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~alanmi&#x2F;abc&#x2F;abc.htm</a><p>[3] <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.princeton.edu&#x2F;~chaff&#x2F;zchaff.html</a><p>[4] <a href="http://minisat.se/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;minisat.se&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fmv.jku.at&#x2F;picosat&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href="http://z3.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;z3.codeplex.com&#x2F;</a><p>[7] <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;projects&#x2F;slam&#x2F;</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"dllthomas";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7618406";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:8;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"11";s:14:"comment_author";s:12:"disposition2";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"9577505";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1173:"I feel like Spotify is regressing in terms of music discovery and usefulness in general.

And I don't want to demoralize you or ridicule the work done already. However, there are a number of problems with the implementation as it stands that make it a bad idea to ask for contributors at this stage:<p>1. There are no tests. How can I be expected to contribute to your project when there's no way I can ensure a change doesn't break existing functionality, or even works itself? Testing remote APIs is a bit of a hassle, but it's what mocking was made for. Short of signing up for multiple payment gateways, there's no current way to test any change I make.<p>2. No setup.py support. This will likely further limit the number of people who contribute as it increases the barrier to entry. A proper project structure is a relatively easy thing that saves you a ton of time in aggregate.<p>3. There is no coherent developer API. Why does XMLGatewayInterface exist if only one gateway uses it? Why isn't there a generic GatewayInterface that abstracts things further, for non-XML APIs? If you're not going to use ABCs or strict interfaces (like zope.interface), you should at least have well-formed documentation: most ivar conventions (Foo.API_BASE, etc.) aren't mentioned anywhere. Why are there exceptions in the lib module that are only used by one gateway (or none)?<p>4. There are a multitude of minor design decisions that, if followed by contributors, will likely cause you pain down the road. Using print for debug output, relative imports, random error handling, "entrapping" functions (why would a function take two optional parameters that are immediately checked for non-None status?), etc.<p>To be clear, I'm very glad you're working on thisit's a difficult (at least incredibly tedious) problem that I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate a Python solution for, myself included. But I don't think this is a very good time to be asking people to fork and contribute. You need a proper foundation built before trying to solicit contributions or you'll end up with a bunch of code you'll need to rewrite later instead of a comparatively small amount you should rewrite now.<p>As the library author, it's your responsibility to build a cohesive, general-yet-customizable, clear interface upon which people can build and test their own gateway drivers.

Imagine trying to get to grips with a Unix shell, if you had no concept of files or directories. In such a scenario, even a simple command like "cat" would seem incomprehensible.<p>If you'll indulge me, I'd like to propose a thought experiment.<p>* * Designing a patch database * *<p>Consider you're responsible for administering a busy open source project. You get dozens of patches a day from developers and you find it increasingly difficult to keep track of them. How might you go about managing this influx of patch files?<p>The first thing you might consider is how do you know what each patch is supposed to do? How do you know who to contact about the patch? Or when the patch was sent to you?<p>The solution to this is not too tricky; you just add some metadata to the patch detailing the author, the date, a description of the patch and so forth.<p>The next problem you face is that some patches rely on other patches. For instance, Bob might publicly post a patch for a great new scheduler, but then Carol might post a patch correcting some bugs in Bob's code. Carol's patch cannot be applied without first applying Bob's patch.<p>So you allow each patch to have parents. The parent of Carol's patch would be Bob's patch.<p>You've solved two major problems, but now you face one final one. If you want to talk to other people about these patches, you need a common naming scheme. It's going to be problematic if you label a patch as ABC on your system, but a colleague labels a patch as XYZ. So you either need a central naming database, or some algorithm that can guarantee everyone gives the same label to the same patch.<p>Fortunately, we have such algorithms; they're called one-way hashes. You take the contents of the patch, its metadata and parents, serialize all of that and SHA1 the result.<p>Three perfectly logical solutions, and ones you may even have come up with yourself under similar circumstances.<p>* * Merging patches * *<p>Under this system, how would a merge be performed? Let's say you have two patches, A and B, and you want to combine them somehow. One way is to just apply each in turn to your source, fix any differences that can't be automatically resolved (conflicts), and then produce a new patch C from the combined diff.<p>That works, but now you have to store A, B and C in your patch database, and you don't retain any history. But wait! Your patches can have parents, so what if you created a 'merge' patch, M, with parents A and B?<p><pre><code>   A   B
    \ /
     M
</code></pre>
This is externally equivalent to what you did to produce C: patches A and B are applied to the source code, and then you apply M to resolve the differences. M will contain both the differences that can be resolved automatically, and any conflicts we have to resolve manually.<p>Having solved your problem, you write the code to your patch database and present the resulting program to your colleague.<p>* * A user tries to merge * *<p>"How do I merge?" he asks.<p>"I've written a tool to help you do that," you say, "Just specify the two patches you want to combine, and the tool will merge them together."<p>"Um, it says I have a merge conflict."<p>"Well, fix the problem, then tell the system to add your file to the 'merge patch' it's making."<p>Your colleague dutifully hacks away, and solves the conflict. "So I've fixed the file," he says, "But when I tell it to 'commit file' it fails."<p>"Remember, this is a patch database," you reply, "We're not dealing with files, we're dealing with patches.

I was already pretty knowledgable about the TVs and I had found a few online for $600-700 (At the time, this was pretty much as cheap as they came) that seemed decent and I wanted to take a look at them in person before buying one. I think I went to Walmart, Best Buy, Target, ABC Warehouse, and finally Circuit City. At almost every store the "salespeople" knew almost nothing about what they were selling and there products were way too expensive for what they were. The only store that stood out to me was Circuit City. Not only did they have a good selection of quality TVs but the salesman I spoke with impressed the hell out me as he was the first that knew more about the TVs than I did. After I told him I was going to use the TV with my PS3, he grabbed an open PS3 from their storage room and hooked it up to a few of the TVs so I could try them out. I was so impressed by the level of service that I went back to the store the next day and bought an $800 TV (I think it was available online for $750 at the time) and I have never regreted the price difference.<p>As long as brick &#38; mortar retailers can offer service beyond what an online retailer can do, they will do fine.";s:12:"story_author";s:8:"kjhughes";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"24";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4126038";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:16;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"74";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"mr_eel";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1576565";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1893:""Its reason for existence is to obtain classified national security information and disseminate it as widely as possible -- including to the United States' enemies."<p>That is _not_ their stated goal.

If the area isn&#x27;t safe, do not even attempt to enter the scene. Fires can instantly flare up and engulf a room in seconds. Rivers can be so cold they cause shock upon entering the water and, in some cases, they cause cardiac arrest. Tiny pieces of broken glass can cause deep, sometimes life-threatening lacerations. An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance&#x2F;PD&#x2F;fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT&#x2F;Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment. Some of that equipment is located onboard a fire truck or an ambulance. Most of that equipment is usually found inside the operating room of your local hospital.

Forcing people into Procrustean categories more narrow than &quot;citizen&quot; for the people of one country builds division in the country and keeps people from treating their neighbors humanely as their fellow human beings. That kind of categorization was wrong and a moral outrage in the days of Jim Crow legally enforced segregation and it is still a bad idea today, even to correct the previous wrong.<p>I care about this issue deeply. I&#x27;m a baby boomer, which is another way of saying that I&#x27;m a good bit older than most people who post on Hacker News. I distinctly remember the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated--the most memorable day of early childhood for many people in my generation--and I remember the &quot;long hot summer&quot; and other events of the 1960s civil rights movement.<p>One early memory I have is of a second grade classmate (I still remember his name, which alas is just common enough that it is hard to Google him up) who moved back to Minnesota with his northern &quot;white&quot; parents after spending his early years in Alabama. He told me frightening stories about Ku Klux Klan violence to black people (the polite term in those days was &quot;Negroes&quot;), including killing babies, and I was very upset to hear about that kind of terrorism happening in the United States. He made me aware of a society in which people didn&#x27;t all treat one another with decency and human compassion, unlike the only kind of society I was initially aware of from growing up where I did. So I followed subsequent news about the civil rights movement, including the activities of Martin Luther King, Jr. up to his assassination, with great interest.<p>It happens that I had a fifth-grade teacher, a typically pale, tall, and blonde Norwegian-American, who was a civil rights activist and who spent her summers in the south as a freedom rider. She used to tell our class about how she had to modify her car (by removing the dome light and adding a locking gas cap) so that Klan snipers couldn&#x27;t shoot her as she opened her car door at night or put foreign substances into her gas tank. She has been a civil rights activist all her life, and when I Googled her a few years ago and regained acquaintance with her, I was not at all surprised to find that she is a member of the civil rights commission of the town where I grew up.<p>One day in fifth grade we had a guest speaker in our class, a young man who was then studying at St. Olaf College through the A Better Chance (ABC) affirmative action program. (To me, the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; still means active recruitment of underrepresented minority students, as it did in those days, and I have always thought that such programs are a very good idea, as some people have family connections to selective colleges, but many other people don&#x27;t.) During that school year (1968-1969), there was a current controversy in the United States about whether the term &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;Afro-American&quot; or &quot;black&quot; was most polite. So a girl in my class asked our visitor, &quot;What do you want to be called, &#x27;black&#x27; or &#x27;Afro-American&#x27;?&quot; His answer was, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be called Henry.&quot; Henry&#x27;s answer to my classmate&#x27;s innocent question really got me thinking. Why not treat all of my neighbors as individuals, one at a time?<p>And anyway I&#x27;ve seen this issue go wrong for people in other countries. Also in my childhood, in the other state I lived in growing up, I had a classmate in the early 1970s who would get on the school bus each day wearing a button that said &quot;Serb Power.&quot; I thought that was very strange, because I knew my history well enough to know that Serbia hadn&#x27;t been an independent country since Yugoslavia was formed after World War I. And, anyway, he was living in the United States and had been born here, so why was he so concerned about Serb power? We all found out during the early 1990s how crazy many people in Yugoslavia were about former historical grievances, which made that country disintegrate and killed many innocent people born long after the grievances should have been forgotten.<p>Most reporting to the federal government about &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; is based on the U.S. Census bureau definitions for ethnicity and race categories, which in turn are based on regulations from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which were announced on 30 October 1997<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitehouse.gov&#x2F;omb&#x2F;fedreg_1997standards</a><p>to take effect no later than 1 January 2003 for data collection by all federal agencies. You can look up the detailed category definitions on the website of the United States Bureau of the Census. As the Census Bureau itself notes,<p>&quot;U.S. federal government agencies must adhere to standards issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in October 1997, which specify that  race  and Hispanic origin (also known as ethnicity) are two separate and distinct concepts.  These standards generally reflect a social definition of race and ethnicity recognized in this country and they do not conform to any biological, anthropological, or genetic criteria.  The standards include five minimum categories for data on race:  &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native,&quot; &quot;Asian,&quot; &quot;Black or African American,&quot; &quot;Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,&quot; and &quot;White.&quot;  There are two minimum categories for data on ethnicity:  &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; and &quot;Not Hispanic or Latino.&quot;  The concept of race reflects self-identification by people according to the race or races with which they most closely identify.  Persons who report themselves as Hispanic can be of any race and are identified as such in our data tables.&quot;<p><a href="https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.census.gov&#x2F;faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191</a><p>It&#x27;s politics all the way down.

However, Flushing is a mixture of Chinese people who came to the city during the 70&#x27;s and a new wave of immigrants in the 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s. So you have a eclectic mix of Chinese people who work in restaurants, aren&#x27;t as educated and also the sons and daughters of kids who were brought up in the old-timers old school Chinese household who worked their way up through the restaurant chains and became owners and sent their kids to good colleges. The old timers&#x27; culture and attitude closely resembles Hong Kong and Taiwan.<p>Group b) are the INTJ and class-A personalities. There&#x27;s a good mixture of both ABCs (American Born Chinese) and FOBs (first generation) in this crowd. A lot of my friends in this group are very ambitious and try to climb the management ladder by either obtaining a prestigious business degree (e.g., going to Wharton) or by working very long hours or by working on guangxi. As a result, socializing is very superficial. Some of the people I kept in touch since college or hang out with on weekends, I find that I hardly really know them at all; they best represent the &#x27;jing&#x27; of Chinese people as in Shanghai and the Mainlander attitude of always being calculating for self-preservation.<p>Group c) are generally the more Americanized Chinese people as they work in non-traditional fields. Although the degree varies depending on where they grew up and their upbringing. You might find some Asian Americans are willing to hang out with both Americans and Asians; some will only hang out with Asian Americans but no international Asians; some will not hang out with any Asians at all. The best way to describe this is the attitude of certain Hong Kongers toward Mainlander immigrants in Hong Kong, some will accept them, some think that they are superior because of their Euro-centric upbringing despite the fact that we all are Chinese.<p>But in general, everyone is very nice in NYC as it is an very international city.

I need a bit of advice as my research on google has not cleared my doubts.
I am based out of Hong Kong as a C++ and Java developer (10 years exp) and my company (an Investment Bank) has decided to move my role to New York. I have persuaded my bosses to relocate me to NYC and they have agreed. Though the HR talks have not yet happened regarding salaries, i would like to prepare and set mine and their&#x27;s expectations.<p>After a lot of research on google&#x2F;glassdoor&#x2F;etc, i have come to the following conclusions:
1. I might not get the best market salaries (Asian&#x2F;NYC being high cost center&#x2F;non native English speaker&#x2F;first timer to USA&#x2F;etc)
2. I should range my salary expectations in a range of 130K-150K just to be safe in the zone and not miss out on the job. Is this fair?
3. I have no option but to work in NYC and live in NJ. It seems that this is the sanest thing to do.
4. Taxes being high compared in NYC, I can safely assume 40% of my salary being cut. So that leaves me in a range of 78K-90K after tax. Assuming my rental will be around 2k and monthly expenses around 1k, that would leave me with 42K-54K. This i believe should be more than enough.
5. My life-work balance might go for a toss given that longer hours are the norm in NYC (Wall Street). Am i right?
6. Given that i will be moving to USA on an L1 B visa? (not a senior management guy) i can apply for a GC (as in Green Card, not the other GC) as soon as i join and get it in around 2-3 years. Am i right?<p>My preparation for my move has not yet started and i am sure that i will have more questions. Since i have no one in USA (friends&#x2F;family&#x2F;etc) i am completely reliant on YC.<p>Please let me know on the above points and if any of my assumptions are wrong.

I was already pretty knowledgable about the TVs and I had found a few online for $600-700 (At the time, this was pretty much as cheap as they came) that seemed decent and I wanted to take a look at them in person before buying one. I think I went to Walmart, Best Buy, Target, ABC Warehouse, and finally Circuit City. At almost every store the "salespeople" knew almost nothing about what they were selling and there products were way too expensive for what they were. The only store that stood out to me was Circuit City. Not only did they have a good selection of quality TVs but the salesman I spoke with impressed the hell out me as he was the first that knew more about the TVs than I did. After I told him I was going to use the TV with my PS3, he grabbed an open PS3 from their storage room and hooked it up to a few of the TVs so I could try them out.

By sketchy, I mean that they may offend someone of a particular set, but are otherwise (in my opinion) brilliant executions that I'm proud of. I've never done anything illegal, and I like to think I have a solid base of ethics.<p>For example, when I was around 17, I picked up a trademarked domain for a popular music group from expiry (they didn't own it prior, was just a holding page for non-related topic). I built an unofficial fan site with pics, lyrics, and news content. It was also optimized towards adsense (20+% CTR), pushed affiliate sales for "bling" jewelry products and eventually signed a 1-year $1k/month advertising deal with my affiliate. I offered email service, networked with other hip hop sites, and made about $100k from adsense before I was graciously C&#38;D'd and handed the name over.<p>Most recently I cofounded a project that was covered on the sites of TIME, CBS, Business Insider, Gawker, and pending an ABC News article. It made the front page of HN as well (thanks guys). That site was Price Of Weed, where we crowdsource and share information about the price people pay for marijuana. Possession is still illegal in most of the world; its easy to assume I'm some sort of stoner/drug pusher because I'm associated with this project, but in reality I don't smoke much at all.<p>Now I'm a biz guy and probably won't be applying to jobs at big corporations. I'd really like to work for a startup, which I believe would be less judgmental and more accepting of my project history. If you were me, would you stick these projects on your resume?

And I don't want to demoralize you or ridicule the work done already. However, there are a number of problems with the implementation as it stands that make it a bad idea to ask for contributors at this stage:<p>1. There are no tests. How can I be expected to contribute to your project when there's no way I can ensure a change doesn't break existing functionality, or even works itself? Testing remote APIs is a bit of a hassle, but it's what mocking was made for. Short of signing up for multiple payment gateways, there's no current way to test any change I make.<p>2. No setup.py support. This will likely further limit the number of people who contribute as it increases the barrier to entry. A proper project structure is a relatively easy thing that saves you a ton of time in aggregate.<p>3. There is no coherent developer API. Why does XMLGatewayInterface exist if only one gateway uses it? Why isn't there a generic GatewayInterface that abstracts things further, for non-XML APIs? If you're not going to use ABCs or strict interfaces (like zope.interface), you should at least have well-formed documentation: most ivar conventions (Foo.API_BASE, etc.) aren't mentioned anywhere. Why are there exceptions in the lib module that are only used by one gateway (or none)?<p>4. There are a multitude of minor design decisions that, if followed by contributors, will likely cause you pain down the road. Using print for debug output, relative imports, random error handling, "entrapping" functions (why would a function take two optional parameters that are immediately checked for non-None status?), etc.<p>To be clear, I'm very glad you're working on thisit's a difficult (at least incredibly tedious) problem that I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate a Python solution for, myself included. But I don't think this is a very good time to be asking people to fork and contribute. You need a proper foundation built before trying to solicit contributions or you'll end up with a bunch of code you'll need to rewrite later instead of a comparatively small amount you should rewrite now.<p>As the library author, it's your responsibility to build a cohesive, general-yet-customizable, clear interface upon which people can build and test their own gateway drivers. If you do that, I promise you you'll have contributors in no time.

You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us.

This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This.

Imagine trying to get to grips with a Unix shell, if you had no concept of files or directories. In such a scenario, even a simple command like "cat" would seem incomprehensible.<p>If you'll indulge me, I'd like to propose a thought experiment.<p>* * Designing a patch database * *<p>Consider you're responsible for administering a busy open source project. You get dozens of patches a day from developers and you find it increasingly difficult to keep track of them. How might you go about managing this influx of patch files?<p>The first thing you might consider is how do you know what each patch is supposed to do? How do you know who to contact about the patch? Or when the patch was sent to you?<p>The solution to this is not too tricky; you just add some metadata to the patch detailing the author, the date, a description of the patch and so forth.<p>The next problem you face is that some patches rely on other patches. For instance, Bob might publicly post a patch for a great new scheduler, but then Carol might post a patch correcting some bugs in Bob's code. Carol's patch cannot be applied without first applying Bob's patch.<p>So you allow each patch to have parents. The parent of Carol's patch would be Bob's patch.<p>You've solved two major problems, but now you face one final one. If you want to talk to other people about these patches, you need a common naming scheme. It's going to be problematic if you label a patch as ABC on your system, but a colleague labels a patch as XYZ. So you either need a central naming database, or some algorithm that can guarantee everyone gives the same label to the same patch.<p>Fortunately, we have such algorithms; they're called one-way hashes. You take the contents of the patch, its metadata and parents, serialize all of that and SHA1 the result.<p>Three perfectly logical solutions, and ones you may even have come up with yourself under similar circumstances.<p>* * Merging patches * *<p>Under this system, how would a merge be performed? Let's say you have two patches, A and B, and you want to combine them somehow. One way is to just apply each in turn to your source, fix any differences that can't be automatically resolved (conflicts), and then produce a new patch C from the combined diff.<p>That works, but now you have to store A, B and C in your patch database, and you don't retain any history. But wait! Your patches can have parents, so what if you created a 'merge' patch, M, with parents A and B?<p><pre><code>   A   B
    \ /
     M

This is externally equivalent to what you did to produce C: patches A and B are applied to the source code, and then you apply M to resolve the differences. M will contain both the differences that can be resolved automatically, and any conflicts we have to resolve manually.<p>Having solved your problem, you write the code to your patch database and present the resulting program to your colleague.<p>* * A user tries to merge * *<p>"How do I merge?" he asks.<p>"I've written a tool to help you do that," you say, "Just specify the two patches you want to combine, and the tool will merge them together."<p>"Um, it says I have a merge conflict."<p>"Well, fix the problem, then tell the system to add your file to the 'merge patch' it's making."<p>Your colleague dutifully hacks away, and solves the conflict. "So I've fixed the file," he says, "But when I tell it to 'commit file' it fails."<p>"Remember, this is a patch database," you reply, "We're not dealing with files, we're dealing with patches. You have to add your file changes to your patch, and then commit the patch. You can't commit an individual file."<p>"What? That's not very intuitive," he grumbles, "Hey! I've added the file to the patch, but it tells me the merge isn't complete!"<p>"You need to add all of the files that have differences that were automatically resolved as well."<p>"Why?!"<p>"Because," you explain patiently, "You might not like the way those files have been changed. It needs your approval that the way it's resolved the differences is correct."<p>"Why to I have to re-commit everything my buddy has made?" he complains, "Seriously, I want to just commit <i>one</i> file.

It's probably better suited for Silicon Valley in 2011 than New York 1997 or Curitiba in 2025. That shouldn't be a surprise.<p>That doesn't mean that Curitiba in 2025 is or is not a good place and time for a YC-like creature to exist. Certain types of people, investors, exits, consumers... make it a good place for certain types of founders abc to receive xyz in exchange for 123. India is very different and obviously the local version at its best would need some adaptations. Who knows what those are.<p>India's opportunities are lots of programmers. Talent available at very low costs. BTW, a local hirer would be able to get much better work for his $25 per hour than a New Yorker can get via elance. A 10 person team could potentially have a burn rate under that of a two person team in California. They have under-served markets. Ballooning markets and they are potentially better placed to understand under-served ballooning markets elsewhere.<p>Anyway, the two conditions that supposedly don't exist in India either do or don't actually need to exist in India depending on how you interpret them. I'm nowhere near an expert and they seem silly to me. (1)Big exits are international. Maybe Facebook would be more open to buying promising small team for $2.5m locally but once you get to $250m you're not going to be off the radar anywhere. (2) Why does the market need to be able to support 2-3 large players in <i>every</i> market. That's not a requisite. It needs to be able to support players in some markets. Luckily some (many) markets are international and can be accessed from anywhere. And India is a large market for plenty of things.";s:12:"story_author";s:10:"skbohra123";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"17";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"2643114";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:19;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"289";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"chewxy";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3947403";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:396:"The

For example, the parser doesn&#x27;t know that functions may be returned from other functions:<p><pre><code>    $foo = function() { return function() { echo &quot;Hello;&quot; }; };
    $foo()();  &#x2F;&#x2F; Parse error
</code></pre>
Instead we have to perform some indirection like this:<p><pre><code>    call_user_func($foo());
</code></pre>
Or like this:<p><pre><code>    $bar = $foo();
    $bar();
</code></pre>
Likewise, the parser doesn&#x27;t realise that functions may be stored in objects:<p><pre><code>    $baz = new stdClass;
    $baz-&gt;quux = $foo();
    $baz-&gt;quux();  &#x2F;&#x2F; Error, no such method
</code></pre>
Again, we have to add an indirection:<p><pre><code>    call_user_func($baz-&gt;quux);
</code></pre>
Or<p><pre><code>    $foobar = $bar-&gt;quux;
    $foobar();
</code></pre>
Named functions can&#x27;t be closures, even though we can declare them anywhere, presumably for historical reasons, ie. this is a syntax error:<p><pre><code>    function foo($bar) {
      function baz() use ($bar) {
        echo $bar;
      }
    }
</code></pre>
Another example of making it unnecessarily hard to use functions is iterable objects, which can only be iterated via foreach loops (ie. there is no way to map, reduce or filter them).<p>Of course, I could also complain about no tail-call optimisation, functions not being curried, etc. but those aren&#x27;t PHP-specific since very few scripting languages seem to get them right for some reason :(";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"mariuz";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7251113";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:2;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"347";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"calinet6";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4147384";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2068:"Just one comment on a minute quote from Penrose that happened to be in the article:<p><i>"To my way of thinking there is still something mysterious about evolution, with its apparent 'groping' towards some future purpose. Things at least seem to organize themselves somewhat better than they 'ought' to, just on the basis of blind-chance evolution and natural selection."</i><p>This is a common fallacy about evolution, and is explained beautifully by the anthropic principle, or in other words, the innate selection bias of our existence. We've self-selected for our own awareness of our circumstance and existence. Things are not organizing better than they "ought" to, they've just happened to organize to a sufficient point that we exist and perceive this process and say things about it like the above quote.<p>It is in the same way that someone who wins the lottery must think themselves exceedingly lucky that they, of all the millions of people participating, have won. They must think there is something mysterious about this, that things turned out somewhat better than they 'ought' to, just on the basis of blind chance.<p>Yet, what is the probability that some person, of the entire pool of people in the world, wins the lottery? One. It has necessarily happened by the nature of the lottery.<p>We as a species have won this lottery, by the mere nature of our sentience. We should not think it mysterious or unusual in any way. However, we are lucky in the sense that we are here; we are special in that we can perceive and understand. As long as we understand the fact that there is no "should" in evolution, this is a perfectly fine thought. it just happened, and on this planet, it produced something able to understand itself. As Carl Sagan said, "We are a way for the cosmos to know itself." Certainly there is much metaphysical and philosophical consequence to our existence, but scientifically and probabilistically speaking, it makes perfect sense.<p>Consequently, I believe it may be much more difficult to reach true AI than some have postulated.";s:12:"story_author";s:7:"llambda";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4146912";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:3;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"31";s:14:"comment_author";s:13:"richardofyork";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4435145";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2827:"I learned Backbone just about 3 months ago and the first project I built (still in developing) with it was a commercial eCommerce web application for a major client.

This isn't just a matter of "people being afraid of what's different" as the article suggests; there are very rational reasons for a profit-seeking firm to exploit the fact that their developers (and those available to hire) are already relatively proficient at writing procedural code.<p>Another, more important reason, is that Haskell is too intellectually demanding for most industrial programmers.  I consider myself an enthusiast of functional programming, but achieving anything practical using purely functional code remains extremely difficult for me, even though I regularly dabble in it during my free time.  The Haskell IRC channel can be helpful, but it's very difficult to square "Haskell is easy enough for anyone to learn" with the inevitable "you are too stupid/impatient/incompetent to use Haskell effectively" taunts you're likely to hear, when you're asking for help to perform a simple task.  Many Haskell evangelists don't understand that most developers aren't nearly as smart or dedicated as they are.<p>I'd be curious to know where most Haskell users believe they lie on the distribution of programming ability.  I'd estimate most of them lie at the 99% percentile, and that any of them arguing otherwise are doing so out of modesty.  (Note that I'd include dedication and curiosity in with intelligence in this metric.)  I believe the most likely explanation for this is that Haskell is a particularly difficult language to use effectively.";s:12:"story_author";s:3:"ab9";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"1566278";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:9;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"171";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"jsdalton";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4660619";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:589:"I'll be the grouchy contrarian and observe that I frequently <i>don't</i> like the more highly voted submissions.<p>Seems the high point submissions are frequently pop science or culture articles (e.g., "Amateur astronomers discover a planet with four suns" or "A Very Unusual Camera That Emphasizes Time Over Space"), while the lower point submissions are articles I actually learn from (e.g. "Exploring the Virtual Database Engine inside SQLite" or "How to do a great product promo video for less than $200").<p>I get enough of the former on Reddit; I come to Hacker News for the latter.";s:12:"story_author";s:13:"martincmartin";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"22";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4659392";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:10;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"372";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"pavlov";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"9243942";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:849:"Mode X was cool.

The Computer History Museum has a bunch of volunteer hardware/software hackers who restore vintage main-frames.

We've driven a combined total of 12 thousand miles to get here.  We're set up financially so we can afford to iterate through start-up ideas without breaking the bank.  We have a great space to work in, and we're meeting a lot of cool people.  I actually talked with a man a few weeks ago who knew William Shockley of Shockley Semiconductor fame.  <p>Yeah, It's been a hard road just to get to Silicon Valley.  I'm sad that I didn't get in to the startup school.  But, I'm sure that I'm going to get a lot more rejections throughout my career as an entrepreneur.  If I wanted something easy, I'd choose a different career.   I'm doing this because I enjoy the challenge.  I'm doing this because I love technology.  I'm doing this because I love the game, and I'm in it for the long haul.

In two days, you have managed to create a community more fucked up than YouTube.<p>2. I started watching <i>because</i> of the outrageous stuff other viewers were doing.  When you go to curb the abuse, be aware of this.  Many of your viewers may be watching only because folks are doing stupid stuff like ordering pizza and making yCombinator pay for it.  Lose the hassles and you may lose the audience.<p>3. Reality TV shows succeed because they're <i>unreal</i>.  TV execs hype up and dramatize all sorts of conflict, because that's what gets viewers to tune in.  Nobody wants to see an ordinary person's life, because it's <i>boring</i>.<p>4. Who do you want to be - Anna Nicole Smith or Paris Hilton.  Your success in attracting viewers is proportional to how trashy you are willing to become.  Anna Nicole Smith and Paris Hilton remain media darlings because we can look at them and think "Wow, look how pathetic they are."  It makes us feel good about ourselves.  Unless you are similarly pathetic, people will not want to look at you.  Respectable people like Tim Berners Lee or Steve Wozniak seldom end up on the news.<p>5. If you <i>are</i> respectable and still choose to go on reality TV, you're setting yourself up to be torn down.  The justin.tv tagline is accurate: "An exercise in narcissism".  Narcissism is going to prompt abuse.  People think that since you've set yourself up on a pedestal, you've given them an opening to tear you down.<p>6. I initially had logged in watch the yCombinator dinner.  That proved impractical because of the technology: the audio quality was shitty, the video would randomly drop out, and you couldn't really see anything anyway.  Part of the problem for attracting a decent community is there's nothing for <i>decent</i> people to do.  That leaves it as a festival for troublemakers.<p>7. Have you guys not read Shirky?

PG, did they ask permission or did they just do it?<p>Regardless, the YC application is pretty much perfect for this type of program, so I can understand that they didn't want to mess with something that worked. Plagiarism is a high form of flattery. The three or four changed or new questions make the TS application worse than the YC one, they shouldn't have bothered.<p>A venture capitalist is one of the founders of TS -- PG sees that as a negative but it could make it easier to get money from a friendly venture capitalist or provide insight into the notoriously obtuse mind of a VC.<p>TS also has more than one session a week. I see that additional structure as a good thing but I'm sure PG would argue that it's taking time away from hacking.<p>
The website of each company certainly shows a difference in mentality -- YC is stylized minimalism, TS is over the top web design you get when you pay someone too much to design you a site.<p><p>So what should you do?

I applied for rejuvenation camps, plastic surgery and many othere expensive treatments because PG said we better start young. Since Cobol and Fortran are useless, I had intensive courses to learn lisp, visual basic, php, .net and ruby. <p>There are still a few details left to smooth, but I think I am very close to be able to apply to YC. I still have no idea of what my startup would do, but PG said this was not important... <p>Could there be something I misunderstood in PG talks ? <p>PS: This is all fake, of course, and ment to be humorous. 
There is only one thing that matters and PG was very clear on this. It is to come up with something that people will want and will be ready to pay for in some way (accept to view ads for instance). Wether you'r old, married & dad, have no technical skills in CS, etc. won't stop you from succeeding if you found a gold vein. It will just be a little bit more difficult to start, that's all... and maybe YC is not the VC to go for. ;-)
