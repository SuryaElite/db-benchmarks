It keeps people tied to your Service as a Software Substitute, and as long long as most people are still ignorant about how technology works, they won&#x27;t notice how the stalker-like nature of a lot of modern soft^H^H^H^Hmalware.<p>As for the few nerds that notice, they can probably be shut up with an obscure option to disable (most of?) the data collection; the number of people that even know the option exists will be insignificant. Some of those nerds can even be distracted with promises of &quot;open&quot; access (to our proprietary APIs we can remove or change without notice); if you phrase it right, it can even sound like &quot;open&quot; is referring to the commons. After a while, some of them may even build entire businesses based on feeding user surveillance data upstream. After a generation, the days of being able to write client software will be long forgotten.<p>--<p>The ongoing Theft Of Privacy (and the closely related The War On General Purpose Computing) are being fought, and this brazen behavior by Microsoft to take advantage user ignorance is taking yet another step down a dark path.<p>Which side are you going to be on? The side that is trying to maintain the remains of our privacy, an open internet, and free computing?<p>The apathetic side that fixes technical problems for themselves, while everybody else gets spied upon a little bit more while their tools become even more removed from their control? I hope you enjoy the consequences of rewarding this kind of behavior. Why should Microsoft (or anybody else) change when they still get paid and maintain their user-count?<p>Or are you the apparatchik, who thinks Cortana (or Alexa, or Siri, ... or Google Analytics) is a useful, cool piece of software? Surely the Big Data being collected is just going to be used for the stated purposes and could never have a noxious effect on users or become an attractive target for hackers or governments?

You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc". If you think of "Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process. If you can't find talent, my guess is that you are probably failing in one or more areas above.<p>EDIT: Formatting";}i:1;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"47";s:14:"comment_author";s:9:"mikeocool";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3353020";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"27";s:12:"comment_text";s:952:"Did you customize your email at all for each company?<p>As someone on the receiving end, I'm way more likely to send you a personal response if you've sent me a personal email, regardless of whether you seem like a good fit for the job.

Consider a few results from encryption and what it presents to the adversary:<p><pre><code>    pw(ABC)     == 928
    pw(ABCABC)  == 928362
</code></pre>
If ABC is a seed to the algorithm, then any seed that shares a prefix and a final character will have information leaked, sometimes enough to reveal the entire generated password for a different seed.<p>Its actually worse than this.  For example, if the adversary knows that:<p><pre><code>    pw(AAT)  == 941
    pw(ABC)  == 928
    pw(BBC)  == 717
</code></pre>
then the adversary knows that the mapping from the character C to an integer is the same as the mapping from character T.  Using the terminology presented in the lecture this is<p><pre><code>    f(C) == f(T)
</code></pre>
and from this adversary can determine information about the result of the password algorithm on other seeds.<p><pre><code>    pw(BBT)  == 717
    pw(B.*T) == 7.*
</code></pre>
Because the algorithm uses a recurrence that generates one ciphertext character from the result of preceding  ciphertext character, the adversary can make further inferences:<p><pre><code>    pw(BAT)  == 728
</code></pre>
which implies that if the preceding ciphertext is 7 and the current seed character is A that the resulting ciphertext will be 2.  Consider<p><pre><code>    pw(BAT)   == 728
    pw(XAB)   == 725
    pw(XAAB)  == 7271
    pw(XAAAB) == 72725
</code></pre>
End ---%&lt;------------%&lt;---------------------------------<p>My second email on Sept 30, 2014 contained the solution to a challenge he proposed in the video of a lecture on the method he gave:<p>Begin ---%&lt;------------%&lt;---------------------------------<p>On one slide during your recent lecture, you present a bit of a challenge, and I noticed that by making use of just the four plaintext&#x2F;ciphertext pairs:<p><pre><code>    BRAIN -&gt; 06076
    TRAIN -&gt; 27732
    GRAIN -&gt; 35618
    DRAIN -&gt; 54349
</code></pre>
One can conclude that the permutation of [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] that controls the mapping g() must be one of the cycles:<p><pre><code>    6159073428  
    8106279354  &lt;- this turns out to be the one
</code></pre>
In fact, with a bit more work one can deduce that it is the second by making use of the additional plaintext&#x2F;ciphertext pair (which appears on the same slide):<p><pre><code>    AND -&gt; 496
</code></pre>
So now we know that<p><pre><code>    g(0) -&gt; 6
    g(1) -&gt; 0
    g(2) -&gt; 7
    g(3) -&gt; 5
    g(4) -&gt; 8
    g(5) -&gt; 0
    g(6) -&gt; 2
    g(7) -&gt; 9
    g(8) -&gt; 1
    g(9) -&gt; 3
</code></pre>
With g() in hand, it is short work to build up the mapping of f().  For these five words, the letters involved are A, B, D, G, I, N, R, and T.<p><pre><code>    f(A) -&gt; 5
    f(B) -&gt; 8
    f(D) -&gt; 0
    f(G) -&gt; 6
    f(I) -&gt; 2
    f(N) -&gt; 3
    f(R) -&gt; 0
    f(T) -&gt; 0
</code></pre>
Notes on decryption
===================<p>The details of this decryption aren&#x27;t very interesting, so I wont go into detail.  I didn&#x27;t need to use a computer, just paper and pencil.  The important observation was that from BRAIN -&gt; 06076 one knows<p>g(0 + f(R)) -&gt; 6<p>and from TRAIN -&gt; 27732 one knows<p>g(2 + f(R)) -&gt; 7<p>thus if g(k) -&gt; 6, g(k+2) -&gt; 7.<p>This means that map(g, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) is some rotation of the list [_,_,_,_6,_,7,_,_,_,_] where 6 and 7 are at two locations apart.<p>Every letter, say &#x27;A&#x27;, which appears in more than two places in any of the plaintext&#x2F;ciphertext pairs reveals information about g().  So BRAIN -&gt; 06076
and TRAIN -&gt; 27732 also reveals that<p>g(6 + f(A)) -&gt; 0  and  g(7 + f(A)) -&gt; 7<p>Therefore, if g(k) -&gt; 0 then g(k+1) -&gt; 7.  Thus, we can now conclude that map(g, [0,...,9]) is some rotation of [_,_,_,_,6,0,7,_,_,_].<p>In this fashion I concluded that map(g,[0,...,9]) was some rotation of
[2,9,1,3,6,0,7,5,8,4].  I knew that g()&#x27;s corresponding permutation was a circular permutation with a single cycle because that was a part of the system that makes it easier to memorize.<p>In general, of course, there could be ten possible mappings, one for each rotation.  However, in practice some of these rotations
won&#x27;t produce a permutation with a single cycle.  This isn&#x27;t really a problem because ten possible mappings for g() are still easy to validate in the next phase where we derive the mapping f().  In this particular case, there were only two possible circular permutations making it easy to decrypt the system with just paper and pencil.<p>The next step is to try out each of the possible g()&#x27;s determined above on the plaintext&#x2F;ciphertext pairs.  For example, BRAIN -&gt; 06076 implies that<p>g(0 + f(R)) = 6<p>applying the inverse map of g() to both sides<p>0 + f(R) = 0<p>so<p>f(R) -&gt; 0<p>In this manner the entire decryption can be performed.<p>End ---%&lt;------------%&lt;---------------------------------";s:12:"story_author";s:8:"jalcazar";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"24";s:8:"story_id";s:8:"10196485";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:14;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"75";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"gatlin";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3352077";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"10";s:12:"comment_text";s:661:"I applied to a kind-of sinking ship in Palo Alto last year.

We're seeing it with all major industry disruptions. It used to be enough for the vested interests to write laws to block out, limit, or otherwise hinder additional traditional competitors (taxi medallions, ridiculous license requirements for florists[1], etc).<p>Now we're seeing these same groups try to initiate and bring in new laws to stop competition that is truly an innovative take on an industry. Such as the Uber amendment[2] that was to be written and voted on in less than 24 hours, or cease and desist notices being sent to Lyft and SideCar, telling them to shelve their business while they investigate whether or not they are doing something illegal[3].<p>Entrenched industries with connections to governments, and governments making tax revenue from these entrenched businesses both have a huge incentive to get old laws enforced past their original intent (which were often written for the sole purpose of protecting those entrenched businesses anyway) and new laws written and passed to shut this down.<p>However, these truly innovative companies are filling a need that the old ones don't. That's why there are more Uber black cars in SF than there were black cars in traditional services before Uber[4]. These companies that are pushing society forward have so much momentum and support from the communities using them that lawmakers are better served listening to the people than ignoring them.<p>I have no doubt that Elon Musk and Tesla will be able to disrupt the car-buying market by selling direct to customers. Maybe we'll see another startup come along and piggyback off of their success by selling other cars direct, blatantly ignoring the protectionist laws, and consumers rally behind them to get the laws changed.<p>I don't know where the future lies in the auto industry, but I do know that innovation and forward progress won't be stopped in the long run, no matter how many road blocks there are. I have huge respect for all of these companies that are not only working on doing the incredibly hard task of creating and trying to sustain a company, but having to fight much larger corporations at the same time.<p>1. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=131571&#38;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=131571&#38;page=1</a><p>2. <a href="http://blog.uber.com/2012/07/09/strike-down-the-minimum-fare/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.uber.com/2012/07/09/strike-down-the-minimum-fare...</a><p>3. <a href="http://thesidecarblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sidecar_cpuc_c-d.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://thesidecarblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sidecar_cp...</a><p>4.

The startup ecosystem depends on the recycling of the profits from successful ventures into new angel investment, venture capital funds, and bootstrapped ventures. An extreme example is Elon Musk, who famously netted $180 million from the Paypal sale and put every last dollar into founding Space X, Tesla, and Solar City. I'm assuming that money was taxed at the long term capital gains rate. If the cap gains loophole were closed, either Space X or Tesla would have been stillborn.<p>Yet Silicon Valley regularly supports candidates and policies that would place large burdens on the entrepreneurial ecosystem. We have plenty of examples of high-tax, high-regulation economies around the world with no startup scene. You can't grow one by punishing success and preventing innovation.<p>The deal that happened today means the top California cap gains tax is going up ~11% this year (PPACA, cliff deal, prop 30). That's 11% of new capital for startups being diverted from Palo Alto to Washington.<p>(And yeah, I'm flagging this article because I don't like seeing pure politics on hacker news.

The storage battery on the Tesla Roadster weighs 990 pounds, stores 56 kWh (about 202 MJ) and discharges in 244 miles (393 km) in normal conditions (vehicle speed and environmental temperature). This is a stellar example of applied science and engineering (it's much better performance than that of similar batteries) but it still represents a big obstacle to wide adoption of electric vehicle technology.<p>As a seasoned former NASA engineer who struggled with these same issues on spacecraft for years, I offer this advice: young people who are trying to decide what do with their lives should seriously consider a career in battery science and engineering.

Your competitors are often subsidized entities, sovereign governments, or extremely well politically connected. Testing is hard because you often only get one shot to get things right, and if things go wrong it could set you back years and destroy hundreds of millions of dollars of work (made only slightly better if you have gone to the trouble of spending lots of money on insurance) and could generate a massive amount of bad PR in an instant that will haunt your company for years.

However, Flushing is a mixture of Chinese people who came to the city during the 70&#x27;s and a new wave of immigrants in the 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s. So you have a eclectic mix of Chinese people who work in restaurants, aren&#x27;t as educated and also the sons and daughters of kids who were brought up in the old-timers old school Chinese household who worked their way up through the restaurant chains and became owners and sent their kids to good colleges. The old timers&#x27; culture and attitude closely resembles Hong Kong and Taiwan.<p>Group b) are the INTJ and class-A personalities. There&#x27;s a good mixture of both ABCs (American Born Chinese) and FOBs (first generation) in this crowd. A lot of my friends in this group are very ambitious and try to climb the management ladder by either obtaining a prestigious business degree (e.g., going to Wharton) or by working very long hours or by working on guangxi. As a result, socializing is very superficial. Some of the people I kept in touch since college or hang out with on weekends, I find that I hardly really know them at all; they best represent the &#x27;jing&#x27; of Chinese people as in Shanghai and the Mainlander attitude of always being calculating for self-preservation.<p>Group c) are generally the more Americanized Chinese people as they work in non-traditional fields. Although the degree varies depending on where they grew up and their upbringing. You might find some Asian Americans are willing to hang out with both Americans and Asians; some will only hang out with Asian Americans but no international Asians; some will not hang out with any Asians at all. The best way to describe this is the attitude of certain Hong Kongers toward Mainlander immigrants in Hong Kong, some will accept them, some think that they are superior because of their Euro-centric upbringing despite the fact that we all are Chinese.<p>But in general, everyone is very nice in NYC as it is an very international city.

I need a bit of advice as my research on google has not cleared my doubts.
I am based out of Hong Kong as a C++ and Java developer (10 years exp) and my company (an Investment Bank) has decided to move my role to New York. I have persuaded my bosses to relocate me to NYC and they have agreed. Though the HR talks have not yet happened regarding salaries, i would like to prepare and set mine and their&#x27;s expectations.<p>After a lot of research on google&#x2F;glassdoor&#x2F;etc, i have come to the following conclusions:
1. I might not get the best market salaries (Asian&#x2F;NYC being high cost center&#x2F;non native English speaker&#x2F;first timer to USA&#x2F;etc)
2. I should range my salary expectations in a range of 130K-150K just to be safe in the zone and not miss out on the job. Is this fair?
3. I have no option but to work in NYC and live in NJ. It seems that this is the sanest thing to do.
4. Taxes being high compared in NYC, I can safely assume 40% of my salary being cut. So that leaves me in a range of 78K-90K after tax. Assuming my rental will be around 2k and monthly expenses around 1k, that would leave me with 42K-54K. This i believe should be more than enough.
5. My life-work balance might go for a toss given that longer hours are the norm in NYC (Wall Street). Am i right?
6. Given that i will be moving to USA on an L1 B visa? (not a senior management guy) i can apply for a GC (as in Green Card, not the other GC) as soon as i join and get it in around 2-3 years. Am i right?<p>My preparation for my move has not yet started and i am sure that i will have more questions. Since i have no one in USA (friends&#x2F;family&#x2F;etc) i am completely reliant on YC.<p>Please let me know on the above points and if any of my assumptions are wrong.

I was already pretty knowledgable about the TVs and I had found a few online for $600-700 (At the time, this was pretty much as cheap as they came) that seemed decent and I wanted to take a look at them in person before buying one. I think I went to Walmart, Best Buy, Target, ABC Warehouse, and finally Circuit City. At almost every store the "salespeople" knew almost nothing about what they were selling and there products were way too expensive for what they were. The only store that stood out to me was Circuit City. Not only did they have a good selection of quality TVs but the salesman I spoke with impressed the hell out me as he was the first that knew more about the TVs than I did. After I told him I was going to use the TV with my PS3, he grabbed an open PS3 from their storage room and hooked it up to a few of the TVs so I could try them out. I was so impressed by the level of service that I went back to the store the next day and bought an $800 TV (I think it was available online for $750 at the time) and I have never regreted the price difference.<p>As long as brick &#38; mortar retailers can offer service beyond what an online retailer can do, they will do fine.";s:12:"story_author";s:8:"kjhughes";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"24";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4126038";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:4;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"101";s:14:"comment_author";s:11:"weavejester";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1342902";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:4328:"Mike, Git seems unintuitive because you don't have a good grasp of what it does behind the scenes. Imagine trying to get to grips with a Unix shell, if you had no concept of files or directories. In such a scenario, even a simple command like "cat" would seem incomprehensible.<p>If you'll indulge me, I'd like to propose a thought experiment.<p>* * Designing a patch database * *<p>Consider you're responsible for administering a busy open source project. You get dozens of patches a day from developers and you find it increasingly difficult to keep track of them. How might you go about managing this influx of patch files?<p>The first thing you might consider is how do you know what each patch is supposed to do? How do you know who to contact about the patch? Or when the patch was sent to you?<p>The solution to this is not too tricky; you just add some metadata to the patch detailing the author, the date, a description of the patch and so forth.<p>The next problem you face is that some patches rely on other patches. For instance, Bob might publicly post a patch for a great new scheduler, but then Carol might post a patch correcting some bugs in Bob's code. Carol's patch cannot be applied without first applying Bob's patch.<p>So you allow each patch to have parents. The parent of Carol's patch would be Bob's patch.<p>You've solved two major problems, but now you face one final one. If you want to talk to other people about these patches, you need a common naming scheme. It's going to be problematic if you label a patch as ABC on your system, but a colleague labels a patch as XYZ. So you either need a central naming database, or some algorithm that can guarantee everyone gives the same label to the same patch.<p>Fortunately, we have such algorithms; they're called one-way hashes. You take the contents of the patch, its metadata and parents, serialize all of that and SHA1 the result.<p>Three perfectly logical solutions, and ones you may even have come up with yourself under similar circumstances.<p>* * Merging patches * *<p>Under this system, how would a merge be performed? Let's say you have two patches, A and B, and you want to combine them somehow. One way is to just apply each in turn to your source, fix any differences that can't be automatically resolved (conflicts), and then produce a new patch C from the combined diff.<p>That works, but now you have to store A, B and C in your patch database, and you don't retain any history. But wait! Your patches can have parents, so what if you created a 'merge' patch, M, with parents A and B?<p><pre><code>   A   B
    \ /
     M
</code></pre>
This is externally equivalent to what you did to produce C: patches A and B are applied to the source code, and then you apply M to resolve the differences. M will contain both the differences that can be resolved automatically, and any conflicts we have to resolve manually.<p>Having solved your problem, you write the code to your patch database and present the resulting program to your colleague.<p>* * A user tries to merge * *<p>"How do I merge?" he asks.<p>"I've written a tool to help you do that," you say, "Just specify the two patches you want to combine, and the tool will merge them together."<p>"Um, it says I have a merge conflict."<p>"Well, fix the problem, then tell the system to add your file to the 'merge patch' it's making."<p>Your colleague dutifully hacks away, and solves the conflict. "So I've fixed the file," he says, "But when I tell it to 'commit file' it fails."<p>"Remember, this is a patch database," you reply, "We're not dealing with files, we're dealing with patches. You have to add your file changes to your patch, and then commit the patch. You can't commit an individual file."<p>"What? That's not very intuitive," he grumbles, "Hey! I've added the file to the patch, but it tells me the merge isn't complete!"<p>"You need to add all of the files that have differences that were automatically resolved as well."<p>"Why?!"<p>"Because," you explain patiently, "You might not like the way those files have been changed. It needs your approval that the way it's resolved the differences is correct."<p>"Why to I have to re-commit everything my buddy has made?" he complains, "Seriously, I want to just commit <i>one</i> file.

The fact that you&#x27;re asking me basic definitions means you didn&#x27;t even pay attention to the stuff I sent you, so you&#x27;re wasting my time and yours. You could have already figured this out ahead of time. Instead, you asked me to take time out of my day (probably during work hours) to ask questions whose answers I&#x27;ve already provided.<p>(Please note that this only really goes for non-entry-level positions. For entry-level applicants, such as kids fresh out of college, you may not have very many code samples to work with. That&#x27;s fine. In that case, send some problems for them to work on at home. Hopefully, these are dumbed-down but real-world problems your company has faced in the past.)<p>## Phone Screen (aka verifying authenticity)<p>The first thing you should do is take a gander at my Github profile or my code samples. Then you call me up at a prearranged time and ask me questions about that code. Make me prove that I wrote what I said I wrote.<p>* I noticed you made this combat simulator (www.bitfalls.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;autofight-php-job-interview-task-part-1.html). Walk me through your thought process.<p>* Your code appears to be a custom MVC. Why did you choose to go with a custom one versus say, CodeIgniter or Symfony?<p>* This project is an API for Nerd Nite scheduling. First of all, what&#x27;s Nerd Nite and why did you make an API for it? Second, explain how you scraped the data, organized it, and output the results.<p>The above three questions will give you way more insight into my programming style and thought process than &quot;What is an MVC?&quot;. Please. Don&#x27;t waste my time. As a senior engineer with 7+ years in the field, I shouldn&#x27;t need to prove the equivalent of my ABCs to you. It should be understood.<p>I personally would also skip the whole &quot;live coding&quot; thing via Stypi or whatever. Waste of time, imo. You&#x27;ve already got code samples and you can ask me as many questions as you want about it. I shouldn&#x27;t need to write code in front of you to establish my credentials.<p>## What about people who lie?<p>There are people who lie about their resume and their qualifications, but that&#x27;s exactly why you should tailor your questions to fit the code samples provided. If I don&#x27;t get excited about that code and I can&#x27;t eloquently explain why I did what I did or how it works, then maybe I didn&#x27;t write it after all. It also gives you an insight as to my personality: I clearly took time out of my day to write this code. Why? What prompted me to write an API for Nerd Nite schedules?<p>The answers to those questions should give you an idea of whether I can actually program or not. Questions like &quot;What is MVC?&quot; can be looked up in a dictionary. Explaining code samples is much more difficult.<p>## What next?<p>Once you&#x27;ve established that I wrote the code I said I wrote, then Step 1 of The Interviewing process is mostly done. Now you bring me into the office to determine Step 2 -- am I someone you want sitting next to you for 8+ hours a day for the next six months? Do I fit in with company culture?<p>You could give me a problem to solve on the spot, but hopefully it&#x27;s more of a higher level thing rather than a &quot;write code on a whiteboard&quot; thing. The reason I say this is because at this point you should already have seen my code. You should know by now that I can build a class. The question you need to answer now is: given an arbitrary problem, can I solve it or at least come up with a reasonable thought process?<p>Bonus points if it&#x27;s relevant to the job. (i.e., if your job never requires you to write binary trees from scratch, don&#x27;t ask the applicant to do so.)<p>## Finally<p>Between the phone screen (technical) and in-person interview (personal), you should have a good idea of whether you want me on your team or not.<p>Occasionally for small teams, you may decide that you need to know something about time, creativity, independence, and other similar qualities that you can&#x27;t really get from code samples. If this is the case, then I suggest doing the contract thing, where you give them an assignment on contract. Once the assignment is finished, you hire them or pay them for the work completed (or hopefully both).<p>I really, really, really despise whiteboard coding. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s indicative of anything, and I think you will find a lot of false negatives (i.e., rule out good candidates) using the whiteboard method.<p>A few other thoughts:<p>* I should meet my potential future boss at the in-person interview<p>* I should meet at least one of my potential future coworkers<p>* Be respectful of my time. Most interviews take place during work hours, so I&#x27;ve taken time off work -- and probably lied to my boss about where I&#x27;m going! -- to meet with you. The least you can do is not waste my time.<p>* Be familiar with my resume and code samples. I took the time to write them, you should take the time to read them. It will answer way more questions about my abilities than a 20 minute quiz on technical terms will.<p>The more informal the in-person interview is, the better. The technical qualifications should already be accepted by the time I walk in the door. At this point, it&#x27;s a two way street as we figure out whether we want to work together. I&#x27;m interviewing you just as much as you are interviewing me.<p>(Note: These are just my opinions about how I interview others. It hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. On the other hand, almost every job I&#x27;ve ever interviewed for has completely wasted my time on that front.)";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"gameguy43";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"26";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"6559404";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:15;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:4:"3314";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"jrockway";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3420310";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1137:"The NBA is a great example of how individual consumers are not their customer.

But, the owners also want money from TV deals.  But they don't want your $20 to watch the game on TV, they want ABC's $3 billion (or whatever) for the right to charge you whatever ("watch these ads") to see the game.  So there is no actual incentive to give you what you want; there is only incentive to sell games to networks at as high a price as possible.

The majority of my students are experienced programmers, but no small number are new to programming beyond very simple stuff.   I&#x27;ve found that Python has a number of aspects that are ideal for first-time programmers:<p>- It&#x27;s dynamically typed.  Say what you want about static vs. dynamic typing, but this is one less thing that newbie programmers have to get right.  There&#x27;s no chance of an error when they say &quot;i = &#x27;abc&#x27;&quot;, if you&#x27;ve defined i to be an int.<p>- It&#x27;s interactive.  The fact that you can &quot;play&quot; with the language within the interactive shell is a huge selling point.  IPython and the IPython Notebook are easy to get working, and for people to work with.<p>- Python&#x27;s restricted command set and simple, regular syntax let you concentrate on ideas: Yes, many newbies to Python (and to programming in general) get confused by indentation, blocks, colons, and the like.  But they&#x27;re going to get confused by the syntax of nearly any language.  Python has a simpler syntax than most other languages, meaning that there&#x27;s less to learn, and less to remember.  This lets the new programmer concentrate on the ideas that they&#x27;re learning, or the implementation of what they&#x27;re doing.<p>- It&#x27;s cross platform.  The fact that people can use Python on any computer they like is a big selling point.<p>- You can easily teach object-oriented and functional-style programming.  Python is obviously object-oriented, but can also be used to introduce functional programming.  In this way, you can expose programmers not only to multiple paradigms in Python, but also in other languages.<p>- You can use it for real applications.  People are often surprised to discover that real-life applications are being written and used in this language that they&#x27;re learning, which seems so simple.<p>I&#x27;m sure that there are more reasons than these.  But let&#x27;s consider the alternatives that the article suggested:<p>- I would be hard-pressed to think of a <i>worse</i> first language than C.  You want to introduce people to the concepts of programming, which means abstractions and high-level thinking.  C forces you to think in terms of the computer and its memory, which is just the opposite.  The fact that it&#x27;s compiled to binary form, that you don&#x27;t have an interactive C shell, and pointers are just three reasons why I think that C would be a very bad choice.  Sure, everyone should learn C at some point -- although I often point out that I&#x27;m a much happier person since I moved to dynamic, high-level languages many years ago -- but if you want to teach the concepts of programming, C is going to require too much learning just to get simple things done.<p>- JavaScript has many good points for beginning programmers -- but the chief problem, in my mind, is the language&#x27;s syntax, which is far too inconsistent and forgiving&#x2F;flexible for newbies.  I think that someone coming to JavaScript from Python will have a very easy time; the mapping of data types is fairly straightforward, and even the notion of passing functions is pretty easy to get.  But the learning curve in JavaScript seems steeper to me than in Python, despite the obvious advantages of being able to work within a browser.";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"btimil";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7122163";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:19;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"313";s:14:"comment_author";s:5:"zeteo";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"2506963";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1209:"The Google Maps location that is ventured around (starting with Telegraph: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8487772/Osama-bin-Laden-dead-killed-yards-from-Pakistans-Sandhurst.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8487...</a> ) is not the actual location of the compound.<p>There are aerial photos of the compound in the briefing obtained by ABC news:<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/Graphics%20for%20background%20briefing.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/Graphics%20for%20backg...</a><p>Based on these photos and looking around the area, I've found the actual location of the compound, which exactly matches the photos from the briefing:<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;msa=0&#38;ll=34.169479,73.244208&#38;spn=0.006045,0.009645&#38;t=h&#38;z=17&#38;iwloc=0004a24df7b882270ef3c&#38;msid=210339682031096163658.0004a24df7b712757fdd1" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;msa=0&#...</a><p>It's still in the area, but a bit further from the Pakistan Military Academy and in the SW direction from it (not NW, as the Telegraph map claims).";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"Osiris";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"20";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"2505610";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}}s:5:"stats";s:0:"";s:8:"checksum";i:4139925103;s:10:"warmupTime";d:12096;s:6:"retest";b:0;}i:17;a:15:{s:10:"avgFastest";i:2149083;s:2:"cv";d:1.62;s:3:"avg";d:2156068;s:12:"cvAvgFastest";d:0.12;s:4:"cold";d:2356363;s:7:"fastest";d:2141970;s:7:"slowest";d:2356363;s:5:"times";a:34:{i:0;d:2356363;i:1;d:2146076;i:2;d:2141970;i:3;d:2142880;i:4;d:2150271;i:5;d:2148460;i:6;d:2146842;i:7;d:2149771;i:8;d:2151565;i:9;d:2154160;i:10;d:2148335;i:11;d:2144629;i:12;d:2149819;i:13;d:2154048;i:14;d:2148219;i:15;d:2148701;i:16;d:2150834;i:17;d:2150869;i:18;d:2149599;i:19;d:2150829;i:20;d:2152206;i:21;d:2147863;i:22;d:2153921;i:23;d:2149613;i:24;d:2147598;i:25;d:2151682;i:26;d:2152391;i:27;d:2151648;i:28;d:2149663;i:29;d:2153723;i:30;d:2151538;i:31;d:2154005;i:32;d:2151389;i:33;d:2154852;}s:13:"originalQuery";s:94:"select * from hn_small where match('abc') order by comment_ranking asc, story_id desc limit 20";s:13:"modifiedQuery";s:171:"select * from hn_small WHERE story_text_ts || story_author_ts || comment_text_ts || comment_author_ts @@ to_tsquery('english', 'abc') order by comment_ranking asc limit 20";s:6:"result";a:20:{i:0;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"289";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"chewxy";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3947403";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:396:"The visualization isn't as good as ABC's - I tweeted this yesterday: ABC's use of the tree map is far superior to SMH's bubble charts. <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-05-08/interactive-budget-2012-how-its-spent/3971410" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-05-08/interactive-budget-201...</a><p>I also tweeted that it's a shame ABC used Javascript infovis toolkit instead of d3";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"mrmagooey";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3947039";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:1;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"74";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"mr_eel";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1576565";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1893:""Its reason for existence is to obtain classified national security information and disseminate it as widely as possible -- including to the United States' enemies."<p>That is _not_ their stated goal.

That kind of categorization was wrong and a moral outrage in the days of Jim Crow legally enforced segregation and it is still a bad idea today, even to correct the previous wrong.<p>I care about this issue deeply. I&#x27;m a baby boomer, which is another way of saying that I&#x27;m a good bit older than most people who post on Hacker News. I distinctly remember the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated--the most memorable day of early childhood for many people in my generation--and I remember the &quot;long hot summer&quot; and other events of the 1960s civil rights movement.<p>One early memory I have is of a second grade classmate (I still remember his name, which alas is just common enough that it is hard to Google him up) who moved back to Minnesota with his northern &quot;white&quot; parents after spending his early years in Alabama. He told me frightening stories about Ku Klux Klan violence to black people (the polite term in those days was &quot;Negroes&quot;), including killing babies, and I was very upset to hear about that kind of terrorism happening in the United States. He made me aware of a society in which people didn&#x27;t all treat one another with decency and human compassion, unlike the only kind of society I was initially aware of from growing up where I did. So I followed subsequent news about the civil rights movement, including the activities of Martin Luther King, Jr. up to his assassination, with great interest.<p>It happens that I had a fifth-grade teacher, a typically pale, tall, and blonde Norwegian-American, who was a civil rights activist and who spent her summers in the south as a freedom rider. She used to tell our class about how she had to modify her car (by removing the dome light and adding a locking gas cap) so that Klan snipers couldn&#x27;t shoot her as she opened her car door at night or put foreign substances into her gas tank. She has been a civil rights activist all her life, and when I Googled her a few years ago and regained acquaintance with her, I was not at all surprised to find that she is a member of the civil rights commission of the town where I grew up.<p>One day in fifth grade we had a guest speaker in our class, a young man who was then studying at St. Olaf College through the A Better Chance (ABC) affirmative action program. (To me, the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; still means active recruitment of underrepresented minority students, as it did in those days, and I have always thought that such programs are a very good idea, as some people have family connections to selective colleges, but many other people don&#x27;t.) During that school year (1968-1969), there was a current controversy in the United States about whether the term &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;Afro-American&quot; or &quot;black&quot; was most polite. So a girl in my class asked our visitor, &quot;What do you want to be called, &#x27;black&#x27; or &#x27;Afro-American&#x27;?&quot; His answer was, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be called Henry.&quot; Henry&#x27;s answer to my classmate&#x27;s innocent question really got me thinking. Why not treat all of my neighbors as individuals, one at a time?<p>And anyway I&#x27;ve seen this issue go wrong for people in other countries. Also in my childhood, in the other state I lived in growing up, I had a classmate in the early 1970s who would get on the school bus each day wearing a button that said &quot;Serb Power.&quot; I thought that was very strange, because I knew my history well enough to know that Serbia hadn&#x27;t been an independent country since Yugoslavia was formed after World War I. And, anyway, he was living in the United States and had been born here, so why was he so concerned about Serb power? We all found out during the early 1990s how crazy many people in Yugoslavia were about former historical grievances, which made that country disintegrate and killed many innocent people born long after the grievances should have been forgotten.<p>Most reporting to the federal government about &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; is based on the U.S. Census bureau definitions for ethnicity and race categories, which in turn are based on regulations from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which were announced on 30 October 1997<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitehouse.gov&#x2F;omb&#x2F;fedreg_1997standards</a><p>to take effect no later than 1 January 2003 for data collection by all federal agencies. You can look up the detailed category definitions on the website of the United States Bureau of the Census. As the Census Bureau itself notes,<p>&quot;U.S. federal government agencies must adhere to standards issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in October 1997, which specify that  race  and Hispanic origin (also known as ethnicity) are two separate and distinct concepts.  These standards generally reflect a social definition of race and ethnicity recognized in this country and they do not conform to any biological, anthropological, or genetic criteria.

Probably best to get all of the details firsthand from your potential team than to guess.<p>Now in terms of Asian&#x2F;Asian-American culture in NYC, it is generally split into three groups; a) the old-timers and descendants living in Flushing and Chinatown, b) the professional&#x27;s who moved into NYC to work for the banks, c) the professional&#x27;s who moved into NYC to work at Silicon Alley&#x2F;Media&#x2F;Publishing etc.<p>Group a) are the people with the most Chinese culture; every weekend, extended families go have dim-sum outings at the Flushing mall with multiple round tables of family relatives. However, Flushing is a mixture of Chinese people who came to the city during the 70&#x27;s and a new wave of immigrants in the 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s. So you have a eclectic mix of Chinese people who work in restaurants, aren&#x27;t as educated and also the sons and daughters of kids who were brought up in the old-timers old school Chinese household who worked their way up through the restaurant chains and became owners and sent their kids to good colleges. The old timers&#x27; culture and attitude closely resembles Hong Kong and Taiwan.<p>Group b) are the INTJ and class-A personalities. There&#x27;s a good mixture of both ABCs (American Born Chinese) and FOBs (first generation) in this crowd. A lot of my friends in this group are very ambitious and try to climb the management ladder by either obtaining a prestigious business degree (e.g., going to Wharton) or by working very long hours or by working on guangxi. As a result, socializing is very superficial. Some of the people I kept in touch since college or hang out with on weekends, I find that I hardly really know them at all; they best represent the &#x27;jing&#x27; of Chinese people as in Shanghai and the Mainlander attitude of always being calculating for self-preservation.<p>Group c) are generally the more Americanized Chinese people as they work in non-traditional fields. Although the degree varies depending on where they grew up and their upbringing. You might find some Asian Americans are willing to hang out with both Americans and Asians; some will only hang out with Asian Americans but no international Asians; some will not hang out with any Asians at all. The best way to describe this is the attitude of certain Hong Kongers toward Mainlander immigrants in Hong Kong, some will accept them, some think that they are superior because of their Euro-centric upbringing despite the fact that we all are Chinese.<p>But in general, everyone is very nice in NYC as it is an very international city. However, you&#x27;ll have to make an effort to make new friends as it is a big city where everyone hurries from one subway station to the next.

I need a bit of advice as my research on google has not cleared my doubts.
I am based out of Hong Kong as a C++ and Java developer (10 years exp) and my company (an Investment Bank) has decided to move my role to New York. I have persuaded my bosses to relocate me to NYC and they have agreed. Though the HR talks have not yet happened regarding salaries, i would like to prepare and set mine and their&#x27;s expectations.<p>After a lot of research on google&#x2F;glassdoor&#x2F;etc, i have come to the following conclusions:
1. I might not get the best market salaries (Asian&#x2F;NYC being high cost center&#x2F;non native English speaker&#x2F;first timer to USA&#x2F;etc)
2. I should range my salary expectations in a range of 130K-150K just to be safe in the zone and not miss out on the job. Is this fair?
3. I have no option but to work in NYC and live in NJ. It seems that this is the sanest thing to do.
4. Taxes being high compared in NYC, I can safely assume 40% of my salary being cut. So that leaves me in a range of 78K-90K after tax. Assuming my rental will be around 2k and monthly expenses around 1k, that would leave me with 42K-54K. This i believe should be more than enough.
5. My life-work balance might go for a toss given that longer hours are the norm in NYC (Wall Street). Am i right?
6. Given that i will be moving to USA on an L1 B visa? (not a senior management guy) i can apply for a GC (as in Green Card, not the other GC) as soon as i join and get it in around 2-3 years. Am i right?<p>My preparation for my move has not yet started and i am sure that i will have more questions. Since i have no one in USA (friends&#x2F;family&#x2F;etc) i am completely reliant on YC.<p>Please let me know on the above points and if any of my assumptions are wrong. Also please feel free to advice me on anything that you think would be a appropriate.<p>Warm regards from Hong Kong...";}i:4;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"443";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"tdavis";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1863416";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2632:"Python could certainly use a generic payments librarylike what libcloud has done for cloud providers. And I don't want to demoralize you or ridicule the work done already. However, there are a number of problems with the implementation as it stands that make it a bad idea to ask for contributors at this stage:<p>1. There are no tests. How can I be expected to contribute to your project when there's no way I can ensure a change doesn't break existing functionality, or even works itself? Testing remote APIs is a bit of a hassle, but it's what mocking was made for. Short of signing up for multiple payment gateways, there's no current way to test any change I make.<p>2. No setup.py support. This will likely further limit the number of people who contribute as it increases the barrier to entry. A proper project structure is a relatively easy thing that saves you a ton of time in aggregate.<p>3. There is no coherent developer API. Why does XMLGatewayInterface exist if only one gateway uses it? Why isn't there a generic GatewayInterface that abstracts things further, for non-XML APIs? If you're not going to use ABCs or strict interfaces (like zope.interface), you should at least have well-formed documentation: most ivar conventions (Foo.API_BASE, etc.) aren't mentioned anywhere. Why are there exceptions in the lib module that are only used by one gateway (or none)?<p>4. There are a multitude of minor design decisions that, if followed by contributors, will likely cause you pain down the road. Using print for debug output, relative imports, random error handling, "entrapping" functions (why would a function take two optional parameters that are immediately checked for non-None status?), etc.<p>To be clear, I'm very glad you're working on thisit's a difficult (at least incredibly tedious) problem that I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate a Python solution for, myself included. But I don't think this is a very good time to be asking people to fork and contribute. You need a proper foundation built before trying to solicit contributions or you'll end up with a bunch of code you'll need to rewrite later instead of a comparatively small amount you should rewrite now.<p>As the library author, it's your responsibility to build a cohesive, general-yet-customizable, clear interface upon which people can build and test their own gateway drivers. If you do that, I promise you you'll have contributors in no time. It's exactly what we did with libcloud and we now support almost every cloud provider out there and even have a nearly API-compliant Java fork (just to lend some credibility to my rambling).";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"auston";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"1863058";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:5;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"101";s:14:"comment_author";s:11:"weavejester";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1342902";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:4328:"Mike, Git seems unintuitive because you don't have a good grasp of what it does behind the scenes. Imagine trying to get to grips with a Unix shell, if you had no concept of files or directories. In such a scenario, even a simple command like "cat" would seem incomprehensible.<p>If you'll indulge me, I'd like to propose a thought experiment.<p>* * Designing a patch database * *<p>Consider you're responsible for administering a busy open source project. You get dozens of patches a day from developers and you find it increasingly difficult to keep track of them. How might you go about managing this influx of patch files?<p>The first thing you might consider is how do you know what each patch is supposed to do? How do you know who to contact about the patch? Or when the patch was sent to you?<p>The solution to this is not too tricky; you just add some metadata to the patch detailing the author, the date, a description of the patch and so forth.<p>The next problem you face is that some patches rely on other patches. For instance, Bob might publicly post a patch for a great new scheduler, but then Carol might post a patch correcting some bugs in Bob's code. Carol's patch cannot be applied without first applying Bob's patch.<p>So you allow each patch to have parents. The parent of Carol's patch would be Bob's patch.<p>You've solved two major problems, but now you face one final one. If you want to talk to other people about these patches, you need a common naming scheme. It's going to be problematic if you label a patch as ABC on your system, but a colleague labels a patch as XYZ. So you either need a central naming database, or some algorithm that can guarantee everyone gives the same label to the same patch.<p>Fortunately, we have such algorithms; they're called one-way hashes. You take the contents of the patch, its metadata and parents, serialize all of that and SHA1 the result.<p>Three perfectly logical solutions, and ones you may even have come up with yourself under similar circumstances.<p>* * Merging patches * *<p>Under this system, how would a merge be performed? Let's say you have two patches, A and B, and you want to combine them somehow. One way is to just apply each in turn to your source, fix any differences that can't be automatically resolved (conflicts), and then produce a new patch C from the combined diff.<p>That works, but now you have to store A, B and C in your patch database, and you don't retain any history. But wait! Your patches can have parents, so what if you created a 'merge' patch, M, with parents A and B?<p><pre><code>   A   B
    \ /
     M
</code></pre>
This is externally equivalent to what you did to produce C: patches A and B are applied to the source code, and then you apply M to resolve the differences. M will contain both the differences that can be resolved automatically, and any conflicts we have to resolve manually.<p>Having solved your problem, you write the code to your patch database and present the resulting program to your colleague.<p>* * A user tries to merge * *<p>"How do I merge?" he asks.<p>"I've written a tool to help you do that," you say, "Just specify the two patches you want to combine, and the tool will merge them together."<p>"Um, it says I have a merge conflict."<p>"Well, fix the problem, then tell the system to add your file to the 'merge patch' it's making."<p>Your colleague dutifully hacks away, and solves the conflict. "So I've fixed the file," he says, "But when I tell it to 'commit file' it fails."<p>"Remember, this is a patch database," you reply, "We're not dealing with files, we're dealing with patches. You have to add your file changes to your patch, and then commit the patch. You can't commit an individual file."<p>"What? That's not very intuitive," he grumbles, "Hey! I've added the file to the patch, but it tells me the merge isn't complete!"<p>"You need to add all of the files that have differences that were automatically resolved as well."<p>"Why?!"<p>"Because," you explain patiently, "You might not like the way those files have been changed. It needs your approval that the way it's resolved the differences is correct."<p>"Why to I have to re-commit everything my buddy has made?" he complains, "Seriously, I want to just commit <i>one</i> file.

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"rahilsondhi";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"5834687";s:10:"story_text";s:1745:"I'm a 23 year old self taught developer.

Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on. Either way, no one is forced into anything.<p>Couple of others useful links with details on this:<p>[0] <a href="http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/view/story.jhtml?id=534355695&amp;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hreonline.com&#x2F;HRE&#x2F;view&#x2F;story.jhtml?id=534355695&amp;</a><p>[1] <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/tag/performance-review" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.adobe.com&#x2F;conversations&#x2F;tag&#x2F;performance-review</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"tmbsundar";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"16";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7196536";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:13;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"351";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"bryanh";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4934373";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2889:"I really love Mixpanel, it is the "best in breed" when it comes to event analytics. I don't think many people would argue with that, it's awesome. In fact, we use it at Zapier for pretty much everything (basic funnels, A/B testing, retention, engagement, etc...) and we haven't even reached our full potential with it yet. But I still have some pretty fundamental beefs with the state of analytics software in general.<p>About the article, the problem stems from the fact that proper analytics is hard and is (arguably) getting harder with more advanced packages.Shouldn't it be going in the opposite direction?<p>It is a lot easier to track discrete downloads or pageviews than some other, more insightful metric, so people will naturally gravitate to the cheaper metrics. Until this is reversed, bullshit metrics will reign.<p>Anyways, my beefs:<p><i>First</i>: how do you decide what data to send into the package?<p>The more data you send, the better (sure), but at a certain point you are just duplicating your internal datastore, so that is too much, right? But not enough and you'll miss a chance to understand a phenomena that you didn't predict seeing (isn't that the point?). After you decide, then you write a crapton of code to send it all (what about backfilling data when you want to track something new?).<p><i>Second</i>: once you are collecting the data, how do you know what metrics to actively track?<p>This is definitely existential, but it's back to the core problem: doing analytics properly is <i>hard</i>. Why couldn't the software let me define some properties about the <i>type</i> of app I am running and suggest some strategies (you have a subscription SaaS app? Try tracking paid plan retention, signup funnels, etc...). Maybe it could go even further with <i>reverse</i> funnels, as in: what events are the most important and work backwards. I could see some automation and discovery possibilities there.<p><i>Third</i>: do I really have to dig around trying to find something useful?<p>All the data is there, the software should <i>tell</i> me what is useful or interesting. It's definitely a hard problem, but I would throw money at software that could send me this email: "<i>Looks like users who experienced event "ABC" also performed your highest priority event "Signup" at a 13% higher rate. This observation is 99% confident.</i>" Of course, you'd need to investigate a littler deeper to see if that isn't just a fluke or something stupidly obvious (like: people who view a page signup at a higher rate than those who don't), but at least I might learn something.<p>I know this is certainly a pipe dream as of today, but I vow to shower someone with money if they can do this.<p>In my opinion, the next generation of analytics software won't just have more bells and whistles, it will fundamentally shorten the time to some sort of real "AHA!" insight.";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"billclerico";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"18";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4933958";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:14;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"245";s:14:"comment_author";s:7:"guylhem";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"5214715";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1522:"I do the same, but I have one thing I miss - an easy way to send the output out for graphs.<p>Tweaking and playing with gnuplot is a loss of time - if on a copy/paste excel and others can understand the data from the label and plot using reasonable defaults without many hints, certainly if columns are identified as datetime, labels etc. there could be a tool to use such hints and make a decent graph (to me, decent means giving a global understanding - sure you can tweak it to look good if you are preparing a report, but a lot of time is spent graphing thinks to figure things out and many graphs go to the trash in the process)<p>My dream is to do my select queries in psql and direct the output to that tool, never leaving psql - so it could be for example something that would be triggered on a new table creation matching a specific name like xx_, then it would simply require prefixing "select" by "create table xx_abc as ".<p>The best way I've found is to save the output to a CSV and pass it to other tools, but there are never quite user friendly and usually can't pick reasonable defaults.<p>There is an OSX psql frontend I tried after it was recommended here on HN (<a href="http://inductionapp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://inductionapp.com/</a>) but it was not that helpful in day to day operations.<p>Yet it seemed to be on the same problem - see this picture <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/induction/induction-visualize.png" rel="nofollow">https://s3.amazonaws.com/induction/induction-visualize.png</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:14:"craigkerstiens";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"18";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"5214072";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:15;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"552";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"dotBen";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1703167";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1864:"Regardless of whether you are forward about it in your resume, there are two things to consider that you havn't mentioned:<p>1) The actual issue is not whether you should mention it on a but whether a potential employer would have an issue if they knew/found out you had built one of these sites.  The subtle difference is that even if you don't disclose on your resume, you need to consider whether they would be ok if they found out post-hire.

I tried to apply to IBM's early-intake (ie non-university) entry route for aspiring developers.<p>The technical interviewers thought it was great, the non-tech HR people were very concerned. I made it to the final few candidates but I think the site was a blip on my evaluation forms and ultimately may have cost me a place there.  12 years later I'm hardly crying over not getting into IBM but it's fair to say it closed doors to the corporate software world (yay!)";s:12:"story_author";s:5:"coryl";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"13";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"1702872";s:10:"story_text";s:1766:"Hi HN, I face a dilemma in wondering if I should include "sketchy" projects into my resume. By sketchy, I mean that they may offend someone of a particular set, but are otherwise (in my opinion) brilliant executions that I'm proud of. I've never done anything illegal, and I like to think I have a solid base of ethics.<p>For example, when I was around 17, I picked up a trademarked domain for a popular music group from expiry (they didn't own it prior, was just a holding page for non-related topic). I built an unofficial fan site with pics, lyrics, and news content. It was also optimized towards adsense (20+% CTR), pushed affiliate sales for "bling" jewelry products and eventually signed a 1-year $1k/month advertising deal with my affiliate. I offered email service, networked with other hip hop sites, and made about $100k from adsense before I was graciously C&#38;D'd and handed the name over.<p>Most recently I cofounded a project that was covered on the sites of TIME, CBS, Business Insider, Gawker, and pending an ABC News article. It made the front page of HN as well (thanks guys). That site was Price Of Weed, where we crowdsource and share information about the price people pay for marijuana. Possession is still illegal in most of the world; its easy to assume I'm some sort of stoner/drug pusher because I'm associated with this project, but in reality I don't smoke much at all.<p>Now I'm a biz guy and probably won't be applying to jobs at big corporations. I'd really like to work for a startup, which I believe would be less judgmental and more accepting of my project history. If you were me, would you stick these projects on your resume? What are your own experiences with sharing this kind of information with potential employers?

For example, the parser doesn&#x27;t know that functions may be returned from other functions:<p><pre><code>    $foo = function() { return function() { echo &quot;Hello;&quot; }; };
    $foo()();  &#x2F;&#x2F; Parse error
</code></pre>
Instead we have to perform some indirection like this:<p><pre><code>    call_user_func($foo());
</code></pre>
Or like this:<p><pre><code>    $bar = $foo();
    $bar();
</code></pre>
Likewise, the parser doesn&#x27;t realise that functions may be stored in objects:<p><pre><code>    $baz = new stdClass;
    $baz-&gt;quux = $foo();
    $baz-&gt;quux();  &#x2F;&#x2F; Error, no such method
</code></pre>
Again, we have to add an indirection:<p><pre><code>    call_user_func($baz-&gt;quux);
</code></pre>
Or<p><pre><code>    $foobar = $bar-&gt;quux;
    $foobar();
</code></pre>
Named functions can&#x27;t be closures, even though we can declare them anywhere, presumably for historical reasons, ie. this is a syntax error:<p><pre><code>    function foo($bar) {
      function baz() use ($bar) {
        echo $bar;
      }
    }
</code></pre>
Another example of making it unnecessarily hard to use functions is iterable objects, which can only be iterated via foreach loops (ie. there is no way to map, reduce or filter them).<p>Of course, I could also complain about no tail-call optimisation, functions not being curried, etc. but those aren&#x27;t PHP-specific since very few scripting languages seem to get them right for some reason :(";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"mariuz";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7251113";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:2;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"347";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"calinet6";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4147384";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2068:"Just one comment on a minute quote from Penrose that happened to be in the article:<p><i>"To my way of thinking there is still something mysterious about evolution, with its apparent 'groping' towards some future purpose. Things at least seem to organize themselves somewhat better than they 'ought' to, just on the basis of blind-chance evolution and natural selection."</i><p>This is a common fallacy about evolution, and is explained beautifully by the anthropic principle, or in other words, the innate selection bias of our existence. We've self-selected for our own awareness of our circumstance and existence. Things are not organizing better than they "ought" to, they've just happened to organize to a sufficient point that we exist and perceive this process and say things about it like the above quote.<p>It is in the same way that someone who wins the lottery must think themselves exceedingly lucky that they, of all the millions of people participating, have won. They must think there is something mysterious about this, that things turned out somewhat better than they 'ought' to, just on the basis of blind chance.<p>Yet, what is the probability that some person, of the entire pool of people in the world, wins the lottery? One. It has necessarily happened by the nature of the lottery.<p>We as a species have won this lottery, by the mere nature of our sentience. We should not think it mysterious or unusual in any way. However, we are lucky in the sense that we are here; we are special in that we can perceive and understand. As long as we understand the fact that there is no "should" in evolution, this is a perfectly fine thought. it just happened, and on this planet, it produced something able to understand itself. As Carl Sagan said, "We are a way for the cosmos to know itself." Certainly there is much metaphysical and philosophical consequence to our existence, but scientifically and probabilistically speaking, it makes perfect sense.<p>Consequently, I believe it may be much more difficult to reach true AI than some have postulated.";s:12:"story_author";s:7:"llambda";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4146912";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:3;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"31";s:14:"comment_author";s:13:"richardofyork";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4435145";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2827:"I learned Backbone just about 3 months ago and the first project I built (still in developing) with it was a commercial eCommerce web application for a major client.

It's a relatively shallow learning curve from Java to Python to JavaScript, but making the leap to a pure functional language is very difficult.  Path-dependence plays a huge part here.  This isn't just a matter of "people being afraid of what's different" as the article suggests; there are very rational reasons for a profit-seeking firm to exploit the fact that their developers (and those available to hire) are already relatively proficient at writing procedural code.<p>Another, more important reason, is that Haskell is too intellectually demanding for most industrial programmers.  I consider myself an enthusiast of functional programming, but achieving anything practical using purely functional code remains extremely difficult for me, even though I regularly dabble in it during my free time.  The Haskell IRC channel can be helpful, but it's very difficult to square "Haskell is easy enough for anyone to learn" with the inevitable "you are too stupid/impatient/incompetent to use Haskell effectively" taunts you're likely to hear, when you're asking for help to perform a simple task.  Many Haskell evangelists don't understand that most developers aren't nearly as smart or dedicated as they are.<p>I'd be curious to know where most Haskell users believe they lie on the distribution of programming ability.  I'd estimate most of them lie at the 99% percentile, and that any of them arguing otherwise are doing so out of modesty.  (Note that I'd include dedication and curiosity in with intelligence in this metric.)

I would love to have a mentor, but I think that I"m going to branch out on my own to find them, instead of drowning in the crowd at Start-up school to exchange three words with  Jessica or Paul.  Instead, I've been considering volunteering at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View to hang out with some elder geeks.  The Computer History Museum has a bunch of volunteer hardware/software hackers who restore vintage main-frames.  These are all really smart hackers who have spent decades in the tech business, and they are spending time in retirement doing geek stuff, because they love it.  These are the kind of people that I want to spend time with.<p>My team and I just moved to Silicon Valley this past year, and we're setting up out entire lives around the idea of having a series of start-ups.  We've driven a combined total of 12 thousand miles to get here.  We're set up financially so we can afford to iterate through start-up ideas without breaking the bank.  We have a great space to work in, and we're meeting a lot of cool people.  I actually talked with a man a few weeks ago who knew William Shockley of Shockley Semiconductor fame.  <p>Yeah, It's been a hard road just to get to Silicon Valley.  I'm sad that I didn't get in to the startup school.  But, I'm sure that I'm going to get a lot more rejections throughout my career as an entrepreneur.  If I wanted something easy, I'd choose a different career.   I'm doing this because I enjoy the challenge.  I'm doing this because I love technology.  I'm doing this because I love the game, and I'm in it for the long haul.

I didn't see an easily-accessible feedback link (note to other startup founders: include this), so I'll post my feedback here:<p>1. Congratulations.  In two days, you have managed to create a community more fucked up than YouTube.<p>2. I started watching <i>because</i> of the outrageous stuff other viewers were doing.  When you go to curb the abuse, be aware of this.  Many of your viewers may be watching only because folks are doing stupid stuff like ordering pizza and making yCombinator pay for it.  Lose the hassles and you may lose the audience.<p>3. Reality TV shows succeed because they're <i>unreal</i>.  TV execs hype up and dramatize all sorts of conflict, because that's what gets viewers to tune in.  Nobody wants to see an ordinary person's life, because it's <i>boring</i>.<p>4. Who do you want to be - Anna Nicole Smith or Paris Hilton.  Your success in attracting viewers is proportional to how trashy you are willing to become.  Anna Nicole Smith and Paris Hilton remain media darlings because we can look at them and think "Wow, look how pathetic they are."  It makes us feel good about ourselves.  Unless you are similarly pathetic, people will not want to look at you.  Respectable people like Tim Berners Lee or Steve Wozniak seldom end up on the news.<p>5. If you <i>are</i> respectable and still choose to go on reality TV, you're setting yourself up to be torn down.  The justin.tv tagline is accurate: "An exercise in narcissism".  Narcissism is going to prompt abuse.  People think that since you've set yourself up on a pedestal, you've given them an opening to tear you down.<p>6. I initially had logged in watch the yCombinator dinner.  That proved impractical because of the technology: the audio quality was shitty, the video would randomly drop out, and you couldn't really see anything anyway.  Part of the problem for attracting a decent community is there's nothing for <i>decent</i> people to do.  That leaves it as a festival for troublemakers.<p>7. Have you guys not read Shirky?

There is only one thing that matters and PG was very clear on this. It is to come up with something that people will want and will be ready to pay for in some way (accept to view ads for instance).
